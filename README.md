MailTape
===========
Feed your inspiration, every Sunday morning.

Each MailTape issue is the result of a collaborative work between a featured guest who curates the three first tracks, a curator who completes the selection, an illustrator and a writer.

Dancers, musicians, illustrators, writers, researchers, artists and creators of all kinds are following MailTape.
                                
We're a not-for-profit art collective. 

Coded with love in Berlin, Toulouse and Paris.
