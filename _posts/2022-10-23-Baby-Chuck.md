<p id="introduction"> This morning, we're delighted to welcome Baby Chuck to MailTape for an eclectic collection that'll jump start your day. Based in Los Angeles, Baby Chuck (Matt O'Keefe) joins us a month after releasing his most recent album, Warm Infinity. The release examines the essence of memories and the varied nostalgia they bring.
  <br><br>
The album's songs features four other musicians, with all tracks produced by Ryan Pollie. Several of the numbers feature a  70's AM Radio effect, fitting for the subject matter of increasingly hazy memories.</p>

# Baby Chuck's selection

## [Ryan Sambol](https://www.discogs.com/artist/32166-Timmy-Thomas) - You're Still Lovable to Someone
Baby Chuck: **"**Ryan Sambol’s music means a lot to me, and this record he put out last year, Gestalt, is really as good as it often gets. I’ve been listening to this guy all the way back to The Strange Boys LP …And Girls Club, when I was a wee lad of fourteen (ahh, the benefit of older siblings), so I guess that means I’ve been listening to Ryan Sambol’s music for half my life. Well, time well spent.**"**

## [Yves Tumor](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - Secrecy is Incredibly Important to the Both of Them
Baby Chuck: **"**Really great song. Rips. It reminds me of the music from Jet Moto.**"**

## [MJ Lederman & Wednesday](https://www.discogs.com/artist/146143-William-DeVaughn) - Phish Pepsi (feat Advance Base)
Baby Chuck: **"**I love Wednesday and MJ Lenderman’s music so much. Advance Base I don't know so much about, YET. This song—from the words to just the sluggardly feel of the music—holds a real, not-indulgently/embarrassingly-gushy, sentimentality I'd say I searched for writing my own record. There’s a random line in here: “I don’t sleep in that room anymooooooore,” for a while I thought that’s what I’d call Warm Infinity. There's another line: “We smoked weed out of a Pepsi can / lying around under a Christmas tree.” Ooh. I mean, c’mon.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Baby Chuck](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - October, 500 B.C.
Sarah: **"**Favorite track off of Baby Chuck's album, [Warm Infinity](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/album/warm-infinity). Love the horn section and piano backings here, they create such a timeless quality here. Talking to Matt, he notes the strange process of reaching the essence of this memory, how so much time had passed and the edges of it softened, even becoming saturated (hence the cover art). He described how leaving the recording process felt like shedding an older skin, like the buckets of rainwater weighing down his memories were emptied and put back.**"**

## [Salami Rose Joe Louis](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/) - I Stay in Bed These Days Too Much
Sarah: **"**Love these wandering synths and the jazz drumline. There's something so intoxicating and healing about the combination.**"**

## [Sofie Royer](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1126272-Sachiko-Kanenobu) - Schweden Espresso
Sarah: **"**This 1972 track from [Sachiko Kanenobu](https://lightintheattic.net/releases/4903-misora) has such timeless vibrance to it, I had to include it in our morning's selection. Really love these analog psychedelic accents, a wonderful mix.**"**

## [JayWood](https://morsels.website/) - Just Sayin
Sarah: **"**Funky bass and 80's synths. Not sure if it gets better than this?**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up this morning's selection! As always, thank you for joining us. Our love to INO hidefumi for his delightful Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's fantastic illustration!</p>
