<p id="introduction"> This morning, we're delighted to welcome Baby Chuck to MailTape for an eclectic collection that'll jump start your day. Based in Los Angeles, Baby Chuck (Matt O'Keefe) joins us a month after releasing his most recent album, Warm Infinity. The release examines the essence of memories and the varied nostalgia they bring.
  <br><br>
The album's songs features four other musicians, with all tracks produced by Ryan Pollie. Several of the numbers feature a  70's AM Radio effect, fitting for the subject matter of increasingly hazy memories.</p>

# Baby Chuck's selection

## [Ryan Sambol](https://ryansambol.bandcamp.com/) - You're Still Lovable to Someone
Baby Chuck: **"**Ryan Sambol’s music means a lot to me, and this record he put out last year, Gestalt, is really as good as it often gets. I’ve been listening to this guy all the way back to The Strange Boys LP …And Girls Club, when I was a wee lad of fourteen (ahh, the benefit of older siblings), so I guess that means I’ve been listening to Ryan Sambol’s music for half my life. Well, time well spent.**"**

## [Yves Tumor](https://yves-tumor.com/) - Secrecy is Incredibly Important to the Both of Them
Baby Chuck: **"**Really great song. Rips. It reminds me of the music from Jet Moto.**"**

## [MJ Lederman & Wednesday](https://mjlenderman.bandcamp.com/) - Phish Pepsi (feat [Advance Base](https://advancebase.bandcamp.com/))
Baby Chuck: **"**I love Wednesday and MJ Lenderman’s music so much. Advance Base I don't know so much about, YET. This song—from the words to just the sluggardly feel of the music—holds a real, not-indulgently/embarrassingly-gushy, sentimentality I'd say I searched for writing my own record. There’s a random line in here: “I don’t sleep in that room anymooooooore,” for a while I thought that’s what I’d call Warm Infinity. There's another line: “We smoked weed out of a Pepsi can / lying around under a Christmas tree.” Ooh. I mean, c’mon.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Baby Chuck](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/album/warm-infinity) - October, 500 B.C.
Sarah: **"**Favorite track off of Baby Chuck's album, [Warm Infinity](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/album/warm-infinity). Love the horn section and piano backings here, they create such a timeless quality here. Talking to Matt, he notes the strange process of reaching the essence of this memory, how so much time had passed and the edges of it softened, even becoming saturated (hence the cover art). He described how leaving the recording process felt like shedding an older skin, like the buckets of rainwater weighing down his memories were emptied and put back.**"**

## [Nice Biscuit](https://nicebiscuit.bandcamp.com/) - Round and Round
Sarah: **"**Really enjoying the releases from this Brisbane-based psychedelic rock/folk band, this one comes off their 2021 album [Passing Over](https://nicebiscuit.bandcamp.com/album/passing-over). The effect of this track is dizzying, love the intermeshed vocals and these the balance of rock and acoustic elements.**"**

## [Sofie Royer](https://www.instagram.com/sofieroyer/?hl=en) - Schweden Espresso
Sarah: **"**The opening track of Sofie Royer's latest album, [Harlequin](https://sofieroyer.bandcamp.com/album/harlequin). Loved her club releases ([Leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLFMfc2QGKE), [Melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2NYBA4MfY0), [Cheerleader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsh4so-DjqM)) and her recent [feature on Toro y Moi's MAHAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vniX7UCBlNI). This album and the last present a completely different side of Royer, with old boogie grooves and silky vocals to match. [Harlequin](https://sofieroyer.bandcamp.com/album/harlequin) is worth a listen through this week, be sure to look out for tracks Ballad of Bobby Beausoleil and Someone is smoking (my favorites).**"**

## [JayWood](https://jaywood1.bandcamp.com/album/slingshot) - Shine (feat Mckinley Dixon)
Sarah: **"**The bass and 80's synths -- not sure if it gets better than this? JayWood's album [Slingshot](https://jaywood1.bandcamp.com/album/slingshot) is such an energizing listen, with tracks like [Pray, Move On](https://jaywood1.bandcamp.com/track/pray-move-on), [Just Sayin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6oLGwBNuyg), and [God is a Reptile](JayWood - God Is A Reptile (Official Video) - YouTube) joining some of the week's essential playlist additions. Basically all of them, the whole album, just listen to it the whole way through and bring your week from a 7/10 to a 10/10 guaranteed. Love the momentum in this track in particular, Jaywood is doing striking work in the music video, bringing an artistic perspective to police violence and activism; highlighting such power in his lyrics. Looking forward to what's next from him!**"**
