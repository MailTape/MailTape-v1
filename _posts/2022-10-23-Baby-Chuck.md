<p id="introduction"> This morning, with a special joy we welcome Tokyo-based jazz and electronic artist [INO hidefumi](https://www.innocentrecord.net/) to MailTape. Known for eclectic tastes and textured sounds, INO's thoughtful selection offers an easy treading into the morning hours.
  <br><br>
[INO hidefumi](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/)'s style stretches from electronic to jazz to ambient music, melding aspects of all these genres in the process. INO joins us following the release of his dark and mellow jazz-electro album, [In Dreams](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/album/in-dreams). This album, like all those before it, was released through his label [Innocent Records](https://innocentrecord.stores.jp/), a pioneer of the **one artist-one label** movement. Through this release and the ones of the past years, INO urges us "Don't Listen, Feel!" embracing a love of music that transcends technicalities or pretension. It's with this attitude that he joins us this morning :) 
</p>

# Baby Chuck's selection

## [Ryan Sambol](https://www.discogs.com/artist/32166-Timmy-Thomas) - You're Still Lovable to Someone
Baby Chuck: **"**Ryan Sambol’s music means a lot to me, and this record he put out last year, Gestalt, is really as good as it often gets. I’ve been listening to this guy all the way back to The Strange Boys LP …And Girls Club, when I was a wee lad of fourteen (ahh, the benefit of older siblings), so I guess that means I’ve been listening to Ryan Sambol’s music for half my life. Well, time well spent.**"**

## [Yves Tumor](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - Secrecy is Incredibly Important to the Both of Them
Baby Chuck: **"**Really great song. Rips. It reminds me of the music from Jet Moto.**"**

## [MJ Lederman & Wednesday](https://www.discogs.com/artist/146143-William-DeVaughn) - Phish Pepsi (feat Advance Base)
Baby Chuck: **"**I love Wednesday and MJ Lenderman’s music so much. Advance Base I don't know so much about, YET. This song—from the words to just the sluggardly feel of the music—holds a real, not-indulgently/embarrassingly-gushy, sentimentality I'd say I searched for writing my own record. There’s a random line in here: “I don’t sleep in that room anymooooooore,” for a while I thought that’s what I’d call Warm Infinity. There's another line: “We smoked weed out of a Pepsi can / lying around under a Christmas tree.” Ooh. I mean, c’mon.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Baby Chuck](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - October, 500 B.C.
Sarah: **"**Incredibly difficult work to choose just one song from INO's impressive and extensive discography. This track is the namesake of INO's latest album release. Entranced by the silky texture in this track... Ino's grounded vocals are a wonderful compliment to the jazzy soundscapes Ino creates with such ease. Truly a dream with the Fender Rhodes piano and this magnetic bassline, the track is aptly named :)**"**

## [Will Sprott](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/) - Psychic Lady
Sarah: **"**From one of my favorite [albums](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/album/vortex-numbers) of the moment! The jaunty percussives stretching through this track are beyond delightful, love the folk vocal harmonies swaying alongside each other.**"**

## [Sachiko Kanenobu](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1126272-Sachiko-Kanenobu) - Anata Kara Toku E (Far Away From You)
Sarah: **"**This 1972 track from [Sachiko Kanenobu](https://lightintheattic.net/releases/4903-misora) has such timeless vibrance to it, I had to include it in our morning's selection. Really love these analog psychedelic accents, a wonderful mix.**"**

## [r mccarthy](https://morsels.website/) - Jyoti
Sarah: **"**A healing synth track to close out this playlist of new and found again discoveries :) I could be anywhere and this song would feel like an embrace, I hope it strikes you the same way.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up this morning's selection! As always, thank you for joining us. Our love to INO hidefumi for his delightful Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's fantastic illustration!</p>
