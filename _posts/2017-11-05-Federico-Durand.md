<p id="introduction">This morning, our guest Federico Durand is inviting you to just “listen”, turn off the thinking box, let go off all interpretations. Do not attempt to analyze each sound. Just receive, simply. Let your eardrums engulf each note. Let go.</p>

# An invitation to meditate on your ability to remain fully neutral
As the constant rummaging of the brain obstructs the sensitivity of our senses, listening can be an art, wisdom to acquire. And what if you just surrendered? Let your ego fade away and allow your pores to just feel, again and again.

Federico Durand’s magnetic vibrations will tingle your bodies, your physical but also your subtle and cellular bodies, penetrating each layer, undulating like tides. His music is like a ball of light journeying through you, dusting all negativity, dispersing light, elegantly, ever so brilliantly.

Don’t give up, you can do it, continue and just “listen”. The next tracks will enhance the challenge. Oracle, Zenmai, Sunspell, are you thinking now? Or did you finally surrender? I really hope so.

As with most practices of concentration and meditation, filling emptiness with sounds of higher resonance is always ecstatic. Some languages are thankfully universal and need no translation.

# **Federico Durand' selection**

+ ## Reet Hendrikson - Meil aiaaarne tanavas
_Federico Durand_: **"**Reet Hendrikson. In the year 2014 I went on tour to Japan for the first time. It was a beautiful meeting with friends in an enchanted land. I had the opportunity to introduce to Nao Sugimoto, owner of the label SPEKK, with whom I work, the music of Reet Hendrikson. Reet recorded a single disc in 1969 with raw, precious renditions of traditional Estonian songs. The artist was in exile in Canada, where she recorded and edited this forest-flavored music, imbued with the color and hardness of the rural works. I am lucky to have one of the few existing copies of the vinyl record and to have collaborated in the CD edition, in a sort of personal homage to this artist that I admire a lot.**"**

+ ## Chihei Hatakeyama - starlight and black echo
_Federico Durand_: **"**Chihei Hatakeyama. He is a very good friend and excellent japanese musician. His sound is full of mist and you can be lost into forgotten memories while listening.**"**

+ ## Steinbrüchel - 06
_Federico Durand_: **"**I remember very well when I listened this music for the first time. I was travelling in a train going to the suburbs of Buenos Aires. I saw old houses, gardens, abandoned lots, and clouds. Steinbrüchel made a really magic album full of detail and delight.**"**
