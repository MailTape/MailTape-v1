# **Federico Durand' selection**

+ ## Reet Hendrikson - Meil aiaaarne tanavas
_Federico Durand_: **"**Reet Hendrikson. In the year 2014 I went on tour to Japan for the first time. It was a beautiful meeting with friends in an enchanted land. I had the opportunity to introduce to Nao Sugimoto, owner of the label SPEKK, with whom I work, the music of Reet Hendrikson. Reet recorded a single disc in 1969 with raw, precious renditions of traditional Estonian songs. The artist was in exile in Canada, where she recorded and edited this forest-flavored music, imbued with the color and hardness of the rural works. I am lucky to have one of the few existing copies of the vinyl record and to have collaborated in the CD edition, in a sort of personal homage to this artist that I admire a lot.**"**

+ ## Chihei Hatakeyama - starlight and black echo
_Federico Durand_: **"**Chihei Hatakeyama. He is a very good friend and excellent japanese musician. His sound is full of mist and you can be lost into forgotten memories while listening.**"**

+ ## Steinbrüchel - 06
_Federico Durand_: **"**I remember very well when I listened this music for the first time. I was travelling in a train going to the suburbs of Buenos Aires. I saw old houses, gardens, abandoned lots, and clouds. Steinbrüchel made a really magic album full of detail and delight.**"**


# MailTape's selection

+ ## Yellow Days - Hurt In Love
_ImaCrea_: **"**Right to the heart. Track after each track, Yellow Days keeps exploring a rich soundscape driven by pure emotion.**"**  

+ ## Oliverpalfreyman - Females
_ImaCrea_: **"**Slow down, keep it cool this morning. This one is for you to stay one more track in your comfy bed in these early days of Autumn.**"**

+ ## Mattiel - Count Your Blessings
_ImaCrea_: **"**Instantly memorable, reminiscence of Nancy Sinatra. Gosh I love so much Burger Records...**"**

+ ## Amber Cruz - Psychedelic Candy
_ImaCrea_: **"**Rare gem I discovered by chance on a late night. Couldn't discern if I was dreaming or if this angel voice was really coming from my speakers. Smooth and delicate voice. Direct connection to the soul.**"**
