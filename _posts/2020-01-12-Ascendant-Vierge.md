<p id="introduction"> 
  This morning, we are extremely thrilled to have ascendant vierge as our dear guests. This duo gathers two rebel spirits, Mathilde Fernandez and Paul Seul. Trying to describe their music with words would only reduce it. They're courageously opening a road to a contemporary genre filled with a unique cathartic energy comparable to what Crystal Castles created 13 years ago. 
  <br><br>I see their motive similar to what I experience when I look at a piece from Fontana, this modern painter allegedly known for slicing holes right in the center of his canvas. Such bold action never leave anyone indifferent, either you hate it or you love it, there's no so-so. And the same it is with this episode, you might stop it after 3 minutes or you might get insanely addicted to it. When creation comes from love, there's inevitably a risk because love doesn't demand an explanation to exist.

# ascendant vierge's selection


## Grimes - So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth (Algorithm Mix)
ascendant vierge: **"**We love Grimes and are always waiting for new songs. This one doesn't disappoint. Deep sub bass and melancholic vibe.**"**

## I Hate Models - Intergalactic Emotional Breakdown
ascendant vierge: **"**New one from young french techno prodigy IHM. There's lots of elements we love and use also in our music. breabeats / aerial pads / rave feels**"**

## Acloudyskye - Alignement
ascendant vierge: **"**We have a guilty pleasure for Dubstep and always trying to keep an eye on what the scene is up to. We love this track for the melodic and textury intro and the sick and unexepted drop #bassface**"**


# MailTape's selection

## ascendant vierge - Faire et Refaire
ImaCrea: **"**From their latest EP "[Bobun Fever](https://bobunfever.bandcamp.com/)", released in May 2019 is a concentrate of vitamins. You have to live the experience to understand it, their concert is an explosion of good humour!**"**

## [Lachinos](https://www.facebook.com/LachinosMusic/) - Alas Rotas
ImaCrea: **"**Solar and psychedelic, this song is a breath of fresh air. This franco-south american-maghrebo-american group amazes us with their exoticism but also with a nice clip explaining the uprooting in a poetic way.**"**

## [Cannibale](https://cannibale.bandcamp.com/album/not-easy-to-cook) - Do Not Love Me Too Much
ImaCrea: **"**It's the madness of this title that seduced me. Going in all directions, from the sounds of the Caribbean and Africa, she takes us on a whirlwind ride until we can no longer stand upright. Perfect for that tropical morning!**"**

## Nubiyan Twist - Tell It To Me Slowly
ImaCrea: **"**Nothing better than a track from the band Nubiyan Twist to close this playlist. Extract from the album "[Jungle Run](https://nubiyantwist.bandcamp.com/album/jungle-run)" released in 2019 on [Strut Records](http://www.strut-records.com/), this collective of about ten musicians communicates their joy and passion through afro-beat, jazz, hip-hop, latin music... A pleasure for the ears! **"**
