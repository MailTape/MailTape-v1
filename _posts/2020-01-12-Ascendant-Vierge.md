<p id="introduction"> 
  This morning, we are extremely thrilled to have [ascendant vierge](https://soundcloud.com/viergeascendant) as our dear guests. This duo gathers two rebel spirits, [Mathilde Fernandez](https://mathildefernandez.bandcamp.com/) and [Paul Seul](https://soundcloud.com/paulseul). Trying to describe their music with words would only reduce it. They're courageously opening a road to a contemporary genre filled with a unique cathartic energy comparable to what [Crystal Castles](https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/track/empathy) created 13 years ago. 
  <br><br>I see their motive similar to what I experience when I look at a piece from [Lucio Fontana](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lucio+fontana&t=ffab&atb=v126-1&iax=images&ia=images) who's allegedly known for slicing and carving spaces right into his canvas. Such bold gesture never leave indifferent, either one hates it or loves it, there's no so-so. It's this kind of radical action which leaded me to curate this episode with (almost) only rough tracks. A frontier I never dared to cross for the past 9ish years of MailTape.

# WORK - BUY - ENJOY
It was all a fantasy. Jump up, shake that away off your mind, purify yourself through dance and let the music waves pump love into your blood and soul. Every second is lived for the first and the last time, only *you* know what's really good for you and others.

# ascendant vierge's selection


## Grimes - So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth (Algorithm Mix)
ascendant vierge: **"**We love Grimes and are always waiting for new songs. This one doesn't disappoint. Deep sub bass and melancholic vibe.**"**

## I Hate Models - Intergalactic Emotional Breakdown
ascendant vierge: **"**New one from young french techno prodigy IHM. There's lots of elements we love and use also in our music. breabeats / aerial pads / rave feels**"**

## Acloudyskye - Alignement
ascendant vierge: **"**We have a guilty pleasure for Dubstep and always trying to keep an eye on what the scene is up to. We love this track for the melodic and textury intro and the sick and unexepted drop #bassface**"**


# MailTape's selection

## ascendant vierge - Faire et Refaire
ImaCrea: **"**My addiction with ascendant vierge started right from their first track "Influenceur". "Faire et Refaire" is their latest track and it's still encapsulating all the energy I'm craving for when I listen to them. If you have the occasion, go to their show to see them live, the chaos it ignites makes any gilet jaunes riot ridiculous compared to it.**"**

## Giant Swan - Pandaemonium
ImaCrea: **"**Virtuosity and chaos, this guys are playing with entropy here. I wonder what Rudolf Clausius would have though of it.**"**

## FUMU - Skinned - 01 A1 - Untitled
ImaCrea: **"**Only UK has the secret to kind of vibes. Perfect drum programming melted with hectic noises and jungle spirit.**"**

## Overmono - Salt Mix
ImaCrea: **"**I missed this vibe for a while, makes me think about Mount Kimbie's beginnings...**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. We hope you enjoyed listening to this episode as much as we had crafting it. Much love and respect to [ascendant vierge](https://soundcloud.com/viergeascendant), and Julie Wojtczak for her stunning illustration!</p>
