<p id="introduction"> 
  This morning, we are extremely thrilled to have ascendant vierge as our dear guests. This duo gathers two rebel spirits, Mathilde Fernandez and Paul Seul. Trying to describe their music with words would only reduce it. They're courageously opening a road to a contemporary genre filled with a unique cathartic energy comparable to what Crystal Castles created 13 years ago. 
  <br><br>I see their motive similar to what I experience when I look at a piece from Fontana, this modern painter allegedly known for slicing holes right in the center of his canvas. Such bold action never leave anyone indifferent, either you hate it or you love it, there's no so-so. And the same it is with this episode, you might stop it after 3 minutes or you might get insanely addicted to it. When creation comes from love, there's inevitably a risk because love doesn't demand an explanation to exist.

# ascendant vierge's selection


## Grimes - So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth (Algorithm Mix)
ascendant vierge: **"**We love Grimes and are always waiting for new songs. This one doesn't disappoint. Deep sub bass and melancholic vibe.**"**

## I Hate Models - Intergalactic Emotional Breakdown
ascendant vierge: **"**New one from young french techno prodigy IHM. There's lots of elements we love and use also in our music. breabeats / aerial pads / rave feels**"**

## Acloudyskye - Alignement
ascendant vierge: **"**We have a guilty pleasure for Dubstep and always trying to keep an eye on what the scene is up to. We love this track for the melodic and textury intro and the sick and unexepted drop #bassface**"**


# MailTape's selection

## ascendant vierge - Faire et Refaire
ImaCrea: **"** My addiction with ascendant vierge started right from their first track "Influenceur". This is their latest track and it's still encapsulating all the energy I'm craving for when I listen to them. If you have the occasion, go to their show see them live, the chaos it ignites makes any Gilet Jaunes riot ridiculous compared to it.**"**

## Giant Swan - Pandaemonium
ImaCrea: **"****"**

## FUMU - Skinned - 01 A1 - Untitled
ImaCrea: **"**ff**"**

## Overmono - Salt Mix
ImaCrea: **"**ff**"**
