<p id="introduction">We are super happy to welcome experimental trumpeter, [Nate Wooley](http://natewooley.com/), in this week's issue. His previous albums range from abstract renditions of Wynton Marsalis tunes to particularly harsh versions of free jazz with obscure multi-phonic trumpet chops juxtaposed with distorted extended techniques.</p>
<p>This morning, Nate recalls the rain-soaked Pacific Northwest he once called home and provides a glimpse into his gentler Sunday morning listening.</p>

# Nate Wooley's selection

**"**I’m going with an all Gaburo Sunday. Maybe we could term it a Gabunday? I have been utterly fascinated to the point of devotion with [Kenneth Gaburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Gaburo)’s compositions and writings for the past fifteen years and [Philip Blackburn](http://philipblackburn.com/), head of [Innova Recordings](https://www.innova.mu/) and a former student of Gaburo’s, recently made me aware of this large archive of under documented performances and interviews/lectures which has been my almost daily listening.**"**

## Kenneth Gaburo - TWO (1962)
_Nate Wooley_: **"**I think of Sundays as generally being rainy days, most likely owing to my upbringing in the Pacific Northwest where heavy rain is the norm. It is a very comforting feeling for me to imagine grey skies and rain and this piece for soprano voice, flute, and bass moves slowly and in a monochromatic way that causes the same feeling.**"**

## Kenneth Gaburo - Noyse (1975)
_Nate Wooley_: **"**My very favorite piece of Gaburo's is his Maledetto – a 50 some odd minute meditation on the word screw. It is both inappropriate for the "lord's day" plus too long for this format, but I think "Noyse" is a nice substitute. It breaks apart the phonemes of speech in a way that is both mentally engaging and somehow soothing.**"**

## Kenneth Gaburo - Mouth-Piece (1970)
_Nate Wooley_: **"**I don’t really take Sundays off which means it’s time to go to work. This recording of Mouth-Piece changed the way I look at everything on the trumpet, and so I’ll end with it as it may inspire me to wash out my coffee cup and begin practicing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Nate Wooley 5tet - For Wee Folks
_Sanjay_: **"**Succinct and short, Nate's version is almost unrecognisable from Wynton Marsalis's original. He slows the melody down to bring it out of focus and lets the soloists emerge in more mysterious ways. [Harris Eisenstadt](http://www.harriseisenstadt.com/)'s drumming and [Elvin Opsvik](http://eivindopsvik.com/)'s strong pulse add an intensity, especially to [Matt Moran](http://mattmoran.com/bio.html)'s vibe work.**"**

## Anthony Braxton & Taylor Ho Bynum - All Roads Lead To Middletown
_Sanjay_: **"**A jaunty break in the road with the arrival of this strong and swinging melody. Of course, a tune with either of these two players would not be complete if this sense was not dissipated for a brief turn in the road and free meander.**"**

## Glue - Chats With The Real McCoy
_Sanjay_: **"**Less is more here, but with substance and depth from this cool trio, Glue, with [Tom Arthurs](http://www.tomarthurs.co.uk/) on trumpet, [Miles Perkin](http://www.milesperkin.com/) on bass and [Yorgos Dimitriadis](https://yorgosdimitriadis.com/) on percussion. Even if there is no rhythm or harmonic development, the sounds move forward with little notes getting stretched and going beyond any pattern, but beautifully, full of surprises and relatively accessible.**"**

## Susana Santos Silva & Kaja Draksler - Hymn To The Unknown
_Sanjay_: **"**A dark and brooding piece, which evolves into a lightness and quiet beauty to complete this rain-inspired issue. A Satie-esque air emerges from the small percussion by [Kaja Draksler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Gpvgcu3X_MyVWaSeJLwMeFAV_ALhQj-) on the strings, which [Susana Santos Silva](https://susanasantossilva.com/) picks up on for a lovely ending.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Nate Wooley](http://natewooley.com/) for his exciting selections, and to [William Girault](http://williamgirault.com/) for the beautiful illustration.</p>
