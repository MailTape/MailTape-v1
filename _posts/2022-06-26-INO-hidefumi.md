<p id="introduction"> Today, it's a very special joy to welcome Tokyo-based jazz and electronic artist [INO hidefumi](https://www.innocentrecord.net/) to MailTape for a morning of Sunday discoveries. Known for eclectic tastes and textured sounds, INO's selection is thoughtful and a wonderful start to our day.
<br><br>
Long time no see, dear music explorers! For the first episode of June, as we begin to feel summer pointing the tip of its nose, I am very happy and excited to welcome one of the most lively and stirring of my recent musical discoveries for, certainly, the catchiest MailTape episode I've ever made.

# INO hidefumi's selection

## Timmy Thomas - Why Can't We Live Together
INO hidefumi: **"**Lyrics that resonate with the present day. And also the intro has such impressive sounds with Rhythm Box "MAESTRO RHYTHM KING" - so loved by Sly Stone and Shuggie Otis. It's been 50 years since it was released in 1972. When will it be a peaceful world? For love we live and die.**"**

## INO hidefumi, Jean Touitou - It's All Over Now Baby Blue
INO hidefumi: **"**A mini-album co-written with Jean Touitou, who is A.P.C.'s designer and a friend of mine. When I visited Paris we recorded it in the studio in the basement of his atelier. I had a good time taking a walk in Montmartre in the rain and going to a recommended nightclub. Listening to this song makes me want to go back to Paris to see him.**"**

## William DeVaughn - Be Thankful For What You Got
INO hidefumi: **"**A masterpiece that is covered by various musicians and transcends races and generations. It contains universal metaphors and statements.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## INO hidefumi - IN DREAMS
Sarah: **"**So textured and interesting to listen through... the vocals are wonderful against Ino's jazzy soundscapes.**"**

## Diogo Strausz - Deixa a Gira Girar
Sarah: **"**hh**"**

## Paula Tape - Body Nature
Sarah: **"**hh**"**

## Wau Wau Collectif - Salamaleikoum
Sarah: **"**hh**"**
