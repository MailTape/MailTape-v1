<p id="introduction"> Today, we are delighted to welcome Tokyo-based jazz and electronic artist [INO hidefumi](https://www.innocentrecord.net/) to MailTape for a morning of Sunday discoveries.
<br><br>
Long time no see, dear music explorers! For the first episode of June, as we begin to feel summer pointing the tip of its nose, I am very happy and excited to welcome one of the most lively and stirring of my recent musical discoveries for, certainly, the catchiest MailTape episode I've ever made.
