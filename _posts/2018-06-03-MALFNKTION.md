<p id="introduction">This morning we are excited to welcome [MALFNKTION](https://malfnktion.bandcamp.com/), the electronic music project of Bangalore-based musician, Aditya Alamuru.</p>
<p>The project derives its sound from classical Indian music, old Indian film music and audio recordings taken from the streets of Mumbai to sounds collected in remote parts of the country. Mixing the sounds of India with hip-hop compositions has allowed Aditya's music to appeal to a wide variety of listeners, both within the country and abroad.</p>


# MALFNKTION's selection


## Wild Belle – Love Like This
_MALFNKTION_: **"**[Natalie Bergman](http://www.wildbelle.com/dreamland)'s breezy vocals and the uplifting melody and lyrics of this song make for a perfect morning listen. The entire album 'Isles' is great.**"**

## Emancipator – Bat Country
_MALFNKTION_: **"**Any song by [Emancipator](http://emancipatormusic.com/) is great for starting your day. It's my go-to-listen for downtempo vibes. This song is from his most recent album 'Baralku'. I picked this because I got to watch him play this album live when he came to India a few months back. Needless to say, it surpassed all my expectations. The entire album is a must-listen! **"**

## Anderson Paak — The Dreamer (feat. Talib Kweli & Timan Family Choir)
_MALFNKTION_: **"**[Anderson Paak](http://www.andersonpaak.com/) is positivity personified. It was really hard to pick just one song of his. I think he says it best: 'This one's for all the little dreamers. And the ones who never gave a fuck!'**"**


# MailTape's selection

## MALFNKTION & Zoya – Be Free
_Sanjay_: **"**'Slowly Paradise' is [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/)’s new solo record—a collection of songs filled with soothing, honeyed singing and bent, frazzled fretwork. On this track, the melody dissolves into improvisation, leaving a haze of wah pedals, loose strums and electronics that float on the surface like glints of sunlight on a dewy morning.**"**

## Yaeji – drink i'm sippin on
_Sanjay_: **"**[Tashi Dorji](https://tashidorji.com/)'s music is at once frenetic and tranquil. But it's tranquility I'm concerned about this morning with this track from the 2015 split LP alongside Marisa Anderson. It's a rolling and meditative five minutes that cycles its way around an abstract melody with clipped harmonics and stuttering fret work.**"**

##  Dualist Inquiry – Soleil
_Sanjay_: **"**[Marisa Anderson](https://marisaandersonmusic.com/)'s fourth album sounds like one long ride into the sunset. Otherworldy landscapes and deft playing aside, this title track is a dark reverie that sounds both foreboding and delicate, like wind rustling through leaves under a full moon.**"**

## Tigue – .......
_Sanjay_: **"**Founded as a string quartet in 2014 in Cape Town, [Shh..Art Ensemble](http://shhart.com/) is now a flexible configuration of players including strings, vocals, electronics and a range of Southern African instruments. Originally recorded by Massive Attack and Ghostpoet, this composition—arranged by [previous MailTape guest Cara Stacey](https://www.mailta.pe/247/cara-stacey/)—sounds so relaxed yet casually surreal, as if lying awake beneath the stars.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
