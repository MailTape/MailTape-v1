<p id="introduction">This morning we are excited to welcome [MALFNKTION](https://malfnktion.bandcamp.com/), the electronic music project of Bengaluru-based musician, Aditya Alamuru.</p>
<p>The project derives its sound from hip-hop compositions, classical Indian music, old Indian film music, audio recordings taken from the streets of Mumbai and sounds collected in remote parts of the country. His debut EP ‘[Hindustani Rascal](https://soundcloud.com/malfnktion/sets/hindustani-rascal-ep)’, released in 2015, was a homage to the golden age of Indian cinema and his second EP, ‘[Vote for Worms](https://soundcloud.com/malfnktion/sets/vote-for-worms)’, was released in December 2016.</p>


# MALFNKTION's selection


## Wild Belle – Love Like This
_Aditya Alamuru_: **"**[Natalie Bergman](http://www.wildbelle.com/dreamland)'s breezy vocals and the uplifting melody and lyrics of this song make for a perfect morning listen. The entire album 'Isles' is great.**"**

## Emancipator – Bat Country
_Aditya Alamuru_: **"**Any song by [Emancipator](http://emancipatormusic.com/) is great for starting your day. It's my go-to-listen for downtempo vibes. This song is from his most recent album 'Baralku'. I picked this because I got to watch him play this album live when he came to India a few months back. Needless to say, it surpassed all my expectations. The entire album is a must-listen! **"**

## Anderson .Paak — The Dreamer (feat. Talib Kweli & Timan Family Choir)
_Aditya Alamuru_: **"**[Anderson .Paak](http://www.andersonpaak.com/) is positivity personified. It was really hard to pick just one song of his. I think he says it best: 'This one's for all the little dreamers. And the ones who never gave a fuck!'**"**


# MailTape's selection

## MALFNKTION & Zoya – Be Free
_Sanjay_: **"**Fresh from the presses, this latest track from [MALFNKTION](https://malfnktion.bandcamp.com/) is a collaboration with LA-based singer, [Zoya](http://www.zoyamusicofficial.com/). Uplifting and melodic sounds for this morning 'hoping to induce positive energy around you and exhilarate your soul'.**"**

## Yaeji – drink i'm sippin on
_Sanjay_: **"**Rapping in Korean and English, the New York City and Seoul-based producer [Kathy Yaeji Lee](https://www.yaeji.nyc/) delivers a nonchalant and breathy vocal track that glides over propulsive drums instead of sinking right into them. A great example of an ocean-deep strain of house, hip-hop, and subversive pop with a fervent DIY aesthetic. If you're in Paris today, Yaeji will be playing at the [We Love Green](https://www.welovegreen.fr/?lang=en) festival!**"**

##  Dualist Inquiry – Soleil
_Sanjay_: **"**[Dualist Inquiry](https://soundcloud.com/dualistinquiry) is the solo electronic dance project of Sahej Bakshi, a producer, guitarist and composer based in New Delhi. This track is a blissful blend of guitar and downtempo electro beats from his 2013 album, Doppelgänger. The use of synth bass and conga drums transforms my surroundings into a pretty calm environment.**"**

## Tigue – .......
_Sanjay_: **"**As well as utilising polyrhythmic patterns, Amy Garapic, Carson Moody and Matt Evans of [Tigue](http://tiguemusic.com/) continuously swap instrument duties, building their sound by incorporating melodicas, gongs, maracas, and tambourines. The trio patiently build small compositions into larger sounding creations to the point where the listener forgets they’re still only hearing three people performing simultaneously.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [MALFNKTION](https://malfnktion.bandcamp.com/) for being our guest today, and to one of our newest members of the collective, [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/), for this episode's illustration!</p>
