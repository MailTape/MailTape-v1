<p id="introduction"> This morning we leave in the forest far from the city, far from pollution, far from the crowded streets of tourists... A moment to get green, to recharge one's batteries in the country, is the philosophy of the [Labotanique](http://labotanique.fr/) group.
<br><br>
Sometimes chance does things well. Besides, that’s kind of how I came across [Labotanique](https://labotanique.bandcamp.com/). Mixture of several styles (pop, jazz, hip-hop ...) their music is like a large greenhouse where we would be spectators of what can be called the expression of plants.

# Labotanique's selection


## [Flavien Berger](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Musician-Band/Flavien-Berger-345609982248978/) - Pamplemousse
Labotanique: **"**For us it's undisputably [the best album of 2018](https://paneuropeanrecording.bandcamp.com/album/contre-temps-2). In this particular track we both love the naïve vibes, the floating atmosphere thanks to his soundscapes and the surrealist lyrics. You can nearly feel the smell of the coffee, the sun rays warming your skin and obviously the freshness of a bitter grapefruit.**"**

## [Vendredi sur mer](https://vendredisurmer.bandcamp.com/)- La femme à la peau bleue
Labotanique: **"**That's a perfect track to chill on the french west coast (like Pornic very close from Nantes where we are living) after some local white wine and a few oysters. Then you just want to quit your daily routine and try to become as the french actors [Jean-Paul Belmondo](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Belmondo) and [Anna Karina](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karina) (maybe the blue skinned woman of Vendredi sur mer) in [Pierrot le fou](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierrot_le_Fou) of [Jean-Luc Godard](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard).**"**

## Mild High Club - Skiptracing
Labotanique: **"**The warmness of the drum machine CR78, the detuned guitars and the floating vocals help to forget the idea of being efficient on sundays.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Labotanique](https://www.facebook.com/labotanique.info) - Nature Morte
Anaïs G: **"**When Labotanique wanted to see Flavien Berger, he crossed my path. Nice meeting and immediate favorite for this group composed of Ronan Moinet and Thomas Cochini. With their latest opus ["47è Parallèle"](https://labotanique.bandcamp.com/album/47e-parall-le), there is a real awareness of our world, our ways of consuming and apprehending our future. Surprising melodies, mixing contemporary poetry with jazzy and hip hop tunes.**"**

## [Monsieur 6000](http://www.monsieur6000.com/) - Océan
Anaïs G: **"**Like Labotanique, [Monsieur 6000](https://monsieur6000.bandcamp.com/) becomes aware of his environment... Through "Océan", we let ourselves be carried by sincere and powerful words.  Special mention for the [beautiful clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQYDH0XY_GM), sensual and the interpretation of the bodies in relation to the object and the universe that surrounds us.**"**

## [Auren](http://www.auren-officiel.com/) - Tout est permis
Anaïs G: **"**Unsettling, combative and sensual. It exudes such a force that you cannot fall under the spell of its pop-folk music. His new album ["Numéro"](https://auren2.bandcamp.com/) released last February is a jewel for the ears and fits perfectly to the soundtrack of your breakfast in bed on Sunday morning.**"**

## [Le Flegmatic](https://soundcloud.com/theflegmatic) - L'autre rive
Anaïs G: **"**Like a cowboy, or an adventurer out of nowhere walking the roads in search of lost irony. Offbeat and a bit sarcastic, he plays with brilliance with the words (as the artists being in my selection). Waiting for this new EP "Ruines Nouvelles" which will be released at the end of August at [We Are Unique!Records](http://www.weareunique.fr/) and supported by [La Souterraine](https://souterraine.biz/), a beautiful glimpse with the title "L'autre rive".**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always thank you so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Labotanique](https://labotanique.bandcamp.com/) for their Sunday selections, and to [Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/) for this stunning illustration. </p>
