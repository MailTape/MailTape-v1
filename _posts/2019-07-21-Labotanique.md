<br><br>

</p>


# Labotanique's selection


## Flavien Berger - Pamplemousse
Labotanique: **"**For us it's undisputably the best album of 2018. In this particular track we both love the naïve vibes, the floating atmosphere thanks to his soundscapes and the surrealist lyrics. You can nearly feel the smell of the coffee, the sun rays warming your skin and obviously the freshness of a bitter grapefruit.**"**

## Vendredi sur mer - La femme à la peau bleue
Labotanique: **"**That's a perfect track to chill on the french west coast (like Pornic very close from Nantes where we are living) after some local white wine and a few oysters. Then you just want to quit your daily routine and try to become as the french actors Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina (maybe the blue skinned woman of Vendredi sur mer) in Pierrot le fou of Jean-Luc Godart.**"**

## Mild High Club - Skiptracing
Labotanique: **"**The warmness of the drum machine CR78, the detuned guitars and the floating vocals help to forget the idea of being efficient on sundays.**"**
