# SAMA's selection



## Bu Kolthoum - Zamilou
SAMA': **"**This is a very empowering track, the music and the video are incredible.**"**

## Maryam Saleh - Wahabt Omri Lel Amal
SAMA': **"**This is a very strong revolutionary song by Sheikh Emam covered by one of my favorites, Maryam Saleh.**"**

## OUM - Lágrimas Negras
SAMA': **"**A beautiful cuban song performed by the brilliant Oum and her band. I love the mix of morroccan with cuban, it is very strong.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Bachar Mar-Khalife - El Hilwatu (SAMA’ Remix)
Jules: **"**I was introduced to Skinshape's music by a close friend who sent me his most famous song,['I Didn't Know'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnD8g_7_-bY). I remember being left with such a feeling of calmness. Then, when I listened to his third album 'Filoxiny' released last November, this other song caught me. Although 'Life As One' starts with the same relaxed atmosphere, the end is full of melancholy.**"**

## Maalem Mahmoud Guinia & Floating Points - Mimoun Marhaba
Jules: **"**This song is taken from 'Colt', [Hilary Woods](https://hilarywoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/)'s debut album she spent 2017 writing and recording in an abandoned flat she was living in at the time.  Jazz drums, classical strings and sensuous synth work slowly wrap and surround the piano melody to design majestic spaces while the Irish singer's voice sounds like a siren's.**"**

## Magdy El Hossainy - Music De Carnaval
Jules: **"**Jean-Baptiste de Laubier is mostly known, by his artist name [Para One](https://soundcloud.com/para-one/), as a DJ and a rap and electronic music producer. He met the film director Céline Sciamma while they were both stuyding at La Fémis and since then [Para One](https://soundcloud.com/para-one/) has scored most of her films. The soundtrack of _Naissance des Pieuvres (Water Lilies)_ is an aerial synthesizer melody which imbues the movie with a mysterious and singular poetry.**"**

## Ahmed Fakroun - Nisyan
Jules: **"**I discovered this song on a music compilation from the french and francophone label [La Souterraine](https://souterraine.biz/), and immediately felt captived by this exotic and soft voice. It sounds like the pirate tales or the great adventure books our parents were reading to us, at a time when lost islands and treasure hunts were everything we needed to dream about.**"**



<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thank you so much for listening. Lots of love to [SAMA'](https://www.facebook.com/sama.saad/) for her Sunday selection, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's stunning illustration! </p>
