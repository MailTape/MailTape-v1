  This morning, we are delighted to welcome Palestinian DJ and electronic music
  producer SAMA' to pick three Sunday morning musical selections for us. Born in
  Jordan, Sama Abdulhadi grew up in Ramallah and is one of the very first
  artists to emerge from the West Bank region. Initially active in the
  early-2000s hip hop scene, she started mixing in 2006 in the first techno
  nights around the city, at a time when “the only DJs in Ramallah were wedding
  DJs”. In late 2018,  SAMA’s Boiler Room performance and the associated
  documentary about the underground Palestinian scene went viral and shed light
  on this electric, vibrant community. SAMA' is also working as an audio
  engineer and managing Awyav, the publishing agency she founded to represent
  independent Arab artists. She is now working on the release of her album.

<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are delighted to welcome Palestinian DJ and electronic music producer [SAMA'](http://www.samaahadi.com/) to pick three Sunday morning musical selections for us.
<br><br>

Born in Jordan, Sama Abdulhadi grew up in Ramallah and is one of the very first artists to emerge from the West Bank region. Initially active in the early-2000s hip hop scene, she started mixing in 2006 in the first techno nights around the city, at a time when “the only DJs in Ramallah were wedding DJs”. In late 2018, [SAMA’s Boiler Room performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9VYKrtziSg) and the associated [documentary about the underground Palestinian scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-R8S7QwO1g) went viral and shed light on this electric, vibrant community. 
[SAMA'](https://www.facebook.com/sama.saad/) is also working as an audio engineer and managing Awyav, the publishing agency she founded to represent independent Arab artists. She is now working on the release of her album.

# SAMA's selection



## [Bu Kolthoum](https://soundcloud.com/bu-kolthoum) - Zamilou
SAMA': **"**This is a very empowering track, the music and the video are incredible.**"**

## [Maryam Saleh]('http://www.maryamsaleh.com/) - Wahabt Omri Lel Amal
SAMA': **"**This is a very strong revolutionary song by Sheikh Emam covered by one of my favorites, Maryam Saleh.**"**

## [OUM](http://oum.ma/?fbclid=IwAR1l18tfG3npulLPRsQvespCFy-el56YxiZKUvWd1X3pn4zrvMpELti-JR4) - Lágrimas Negras
SAMA': **"**A beautiful cuban song performed by the brilliant Oum and her band. I love the mix of morroccan with cuban, it is very strong.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Bachar Mar-Khalife](https://www.facebook.com/bmkhalife/) - El Hilwatu (SAMA’ Remix)
Jules: **"**We had the chance the welcome Franco-Lebanese singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist [Bachar Mar-Khalife](https://www.facebook.com/bmkhalife/) in [Episode 337](https://www.mailta.pe/337/bachar-mar-khalife/), just after the release of his fourth album “The Water Wheel A Tribute To Hamza El Din”. He proposed SAMA' to work on a remix of "El Hilwatu", which concludes the album. A bit rough in the morning but this rhythmic and heady note, which sometimes flirts with trance, enhanced with SAMA's energy will surely help you get through the day.**"**

## Maalem Mahmoud Guinia & Floating Points - Mimoun Marhaba
Jules: **"****"**

## Magdy El Hossainy - Music De Carnaval
Jules: **"**'Music de Carnaval' was originally recorded in 1972 during a one take jam session in Cairo.**"**

## Ahmed Fakroun - Nisyan
Jules: **"**I was introduced to Skinshape’s music by a close friend who sent me his most famous song,‘I Didn’t Know’. I remember being left with such a feeling of calmness. Then, when I listened to his third album ‘Filoxiny’ released last November, this other song caught me. Although ‘Life As One’ starts with the same relaxed atmosphere, the end is full of melancholy.**"**



<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thank you so much for listening. Lots of love to [SAMA'](https://www.facebook.com/sama.saad/) for her Sunday selection, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's stunning illustration! </p>
