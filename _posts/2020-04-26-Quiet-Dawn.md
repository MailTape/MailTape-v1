<p id="introduction"> This morning, we're away from the troubles. In our bed to wander around, or on our deckchair to be gilded in our garden for the lucky ones, our mind wanders elsewhere to find the inner peace we need. How can you think about tomorrow when it's far away or blurry? Enjoying the present moment is the best resolution as well as listening to this Sunday's selection made by the artist Quiet Dawn.

# Quiet Dawn's selection

## Bugz In The Attic - Redhanded
Quiet Dawn: **"**I really love this track, one of my favorite from Bugz, the rhythm makes me want to dance even the morning and I'm a really bad dancer.**"**

## Ice - Reality
Quiet Dawn: **"**I chose this track because it's my alarm clock every morning. The start of the track give me smile even if sometimes i prefer to stay in my bed. Unfortunately, I can't listen this track in the middle of the day when my wife is with me, because she doesn't like my alarm when I wake up before her, haha!**"**

## Antonio Carlos Jobim - Brazil
Quiet Dawn: **"**I'm in totally in love with Bossa Nova, all the album is lovely. I don't know why I love to listen to this track especially the morning but it gives off sweetness and the sunday morning when you prepare your breakfast it's cool.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Quiet Dawn - Being
Anaïs G: **"** **"**

## Tigran Hamasyan - Vardavar
Anaïs G: **"**It was in the course of a conversation with a friend that I discovered this Armenian jazz pianist. It was this song that made me want to listen to more of his songs. An explosion of the senses, a patchwork of a thousand colours, that's how I could describe his music! Several facets that I can't wait to discover through these different albums...**"**

## Swarvy - Spam Grease (Feat Kiefer Schakelford)
Anaïs G: **"** **"**

## Hania Rani - 
Anaïs G: **"**Who says you need lyrics to make a song better? Hania Rani is proof of that. This pianist, composer and musician has touched me in the depths of my soul with her music that has no borders and no colour. Each note is an emotion, it's beautiful and sublime!**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning, thank you so much for being with us every Sunday morning! Much love and respect to Quiet Dawn for his wonderful Sunday selections, and to Anthony Dujardin for this episode's stunning illustration.</p>
