# Quiet Dawn's selection

## Bugz In The Attic - Redhanded
Quiet Dawn: **"**I really love this track, one of my favorite from Bugz, the rhythm makes me want to dance even the morning and I'm a really bad dancer.**"**

## Ice - Reality
Quiet Dawn: **"**I chose this track because it's my alarm clock every morning. The start of the track give me smile even if sometimes i prefer to stay in my bed. Unfortunately, I can't listen this track in the middle of the day when my wife is with me, because she doesn't like my alarm when I wake up before her, haha!**"**

## Antonio Carlos Jobim - Brazil
Quiet Dawn: **"**I'm in totally in love with Bossa Nova, all the album is lovely. I don't know why I love to listen to this track especially the morning but it gives off sweetness and the sunday morning when you prepare your breakfast it's cool.**"**
