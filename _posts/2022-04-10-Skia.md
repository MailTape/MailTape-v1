<p id="introduction">This morning,You get up motivated and determined to make a difference. We know that anything is possible, by hoping for the best, by uniting our voices and by not forgetting our rights and our commitments! This is the case with our artist of the day, [Skia](http://skiamusic.com/).

[Skia](https://www.facebook.com/SkiaOn/), a committed and sincere artist, she is one of the French rappers who weighs more and more in the game, as they say! “[Sensible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW1QvC-i2Rw&list=OLAK5uy_nDoW1akljEaBXktJ6jEMNipSswSMVSBXE)” is the name of her first EP released last January, on [Because Music](http://www.because.tv/).

# Skia' selection

## [IAM](https://www.be-shop.fr/) - Sombres Manoeuvres
Skia: **"**I simply choose it because I think that it is IAM's best track and also because I love the fact that they managed to tell the same story through the eyes of two different people.**"**

## [PLK](https://www.facebook.com/plkrappeur) - Le Sel
Skia: **"**I love this track because I passed from this artist for a long time and I find that it brings in a real entire mood. We find the same atmosphere in the track "[Du mal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-CToo2ne78)" that I like a lot too.**"**

## [Nekfeu](https://www.instagram.com/neklefeu/) - Mauvaise Graine
Skia: **"**This track motivates me a lot. Personally, I find myself there a lot. And I just love Nekfeu's writing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Skia](http://skiamusic.com/) - Maladresse
Anaïs G : **"**[Skia](https://www.facebook.com/SkiaOn/), that’s what we need to have a good Sunday’s presidential vote. Commitment, power, sensitivity but also good vibes. That’s what I found in her first EP “Sensible”, signed by Because Music.**"**  

## [George Ka](https://www.facebook.com/georgekamusique/) - Garçon Manqué Fille Manquante
Anaïs G: **"**George Ka is an artist I love, I discovered her with the title “[Saigon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To5wgj9mMnQ)”. And lately I came across this title which is fair, sincere and honest about the condition of women and how they are treated on a day-to-day basis.**"**

## [Lou & The Yakuza](https://www.facebook.com/LousAndTheYakuza/) - Courant d'Air
Anaïs G: **"**As with Skia, George Ka or Mélodie Lauret, I love their commitment, their sincerity and their position on issues that concern us all. Lou & The Yakuza is one of them! I had missed her album “[Gore](https://www.lousandtheyakuza.com/)” and listening to it I can only find myself in her lyrics that particularly touch me!**"**

## [Mélodie Lauret](https://www.facebook.com/melodielauretoff/) - doucement
Anaïs G: **"**To finish this playist on a light, calm and joyful note, nothing beats a Mélodie Lauret title. An emotion out of time, an incredible sensitivity! She had already touched me with her title “[tes cheveux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CafuxD4lYl4)” and “[doucement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yUEApBG2SU)” only confirms my love for her!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our thanks to [Skia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQEd436dMjreraZkXQNXgHg) for this  selection. Many thanks to [Noémie Dijon](https://noemiedijon.tumblr.com/) for this episode's wonderful illustration!</p>
