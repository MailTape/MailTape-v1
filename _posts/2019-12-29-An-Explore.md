# An Explore's selection


## Booker T & the MGs – Soul Dressing
Rob: **"**It’s a super slinky bossa nova slide-out-from-duvet-to-make-tea with this as your soundtrack... An amazing organ-led four piece band working in effortless groove. After listening to this I could go straight back to bed knowing the day had been well spent already.**"**

## Steve Reich – Electric Counterpoint 1.2.3
Rob: **"**Refreshing, cleansing, clearing any hangover from the night before. Prepares the mind for newness of thought and action. The musical detox. Green Tea, Apple and Carrot Juice – things that are good for you…. Reset reset reset. Actually ups your IQ 10 points. Let it float around you and lift you to a higher plane……**"**

## Quincy Jones – Walking In Space LP
Rob: **"**Everything as it should be. Beautifully played, beautifully recorded. Swinging, sassy, funky. Lots of gospel overtones to bring that Sunday feeling. It will have you skipping around in your dressing gown and if it has to be one track, it’s “Killer Joe”. But really this is an album to be played from start to finish…**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [An Explore](https://anexplore.bandcamp.com/) - Small Drop (Suikinkutsu)
Jules: **"****"**

## [Slow Meadow](https://slowmeadow.bandcamp.com/) - Artificial Algorithm
Jules: **"****"**

## Manitoba - Brandon
Jules: **"**Manitoba was Dan Snaith's original stage name, before he was forced to change it to [Caribou](https://caribouband.bandcamp.com/) (and his house music alter-ego Daphni). Manitoba is also the name of a province at the centre of Canada. Taken from Snaith's first album "Start Breaking My heart" released in 2001, to me this track evokes both the vast plains of Canada where the wind rushes in without any noise and the sadness of abandoned urban landscapes.**"**

## Maksim - Untitled (A2)
Jules: **"**A damn fine coffee served with a slice of cherry pie at the same table as Dale Cooper. In the background, the silhouette of Bill Murray wandering in a Japanese hotel. In the distance, the enchanting voices of Scarlett Johansson and Julee Cruise. Everything you could dream of on a Sunday morning is in this untitled track from [Maksim](https://www.facebook.com/maksimresolute/), one of the DJs revealed by the NY-based vinyl only label [ALINE Brooklyn](https://www.facebook.com/alinebrooklynn/).**"**
