## Booker T & the MGs – Soul Dressing
Rob: **"**It’s a super slinky bossa nova slide-out-from-duvet-to-make-tea with this as your soundtrack... An amazing organ-led four piece band working in effortless groove. After listening to this I could go straight back to bed knowing the day had been well spent already.**"**

## Steve Reich – Electric Counterpoint 1.2.3
Rob: **"**Refreshing, cleansing, clearing any hangover from the night before. Prepares the mind for newness of thought and action. The musical detox. Green Tea, Apple and Carrot Juice – things that are good for you…. Reset reset reset. Actually ups your IQ 10 points. Let it float around you and lift you to a higher plane……**"**

## Quincy Jones – Walking In Space LP
Rob: **"**Everything as it should be. Beautifully played, beautifully recorded. Swinging, sassy, funky. Lots of gospel overtones to bring that Sunday feeling. It will have you skipping around in your dressing gown and if it has to be one track, it’s “Killer Joe”. But really this is an album to be played from start to finish…**"**
