<p id="introduction">This morning, we're thrilled to welcome Guatemalan cellist and composer [Mabe Fratti](https://mabefratti1.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape for a Sunday selection of experimental instrumentals and melodies :) Mabe consistently pushes our expectations of classical and melodic standards, treading into territories of provocative dissonance across all of her albums.</p>

# Mabe Fratti's selection

## [Giacinto Scelsi](http://www.scelsi.it/en/biography/) - Pranam II (1973)
Mabe Fratti: **"**I remember when I heard this track for the first time in Luca Guadagnino’s “A Bigger Splash”. It was incredibly powerful and I had to look it up. I ended up loving Scelsi’s work. What I love about this track is the immense layering that goes on, with slow and long gestures that create dissonance and tension. This immense variety of layering that happens in all frequencies, there are so many spaces in the spectrum that are filled out, give a sensation of fullness.**"**

## [Scott Walker](https://www.discogs.com/Scott-Walker-Tilt/master/68203) - Bolivia '95 
Mabe Fratti: **"**[Tilt](https://www.discogs.com/Scott-Walker-Tilt/master/68203) is probably one of my favourite albums of all time, and this particular track is one of my favourites because I feel the spaciousness and detail of every instrument and texture that is added to this track. Besides, the narrative that Scott Walker’s voice makes going from the atonal to a melodic and delicate rhythm feels amazing. The effects of the guitar, this panned tremolo, it all feels in the right place.**"**

## [Fatou Seidi Ghali](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/01/fatou-seidi-ghali-the-worlds-first-female-tuareg-guitarist) - Telilit
Mabe Fratti: **"**I love [Les Filles de Illighadad](https://lesfillesdeillighadad.bandcamp.com/album/les-filles-de-illighadad), and this live version of Telilit is amazing. Not the power of repetition is felt in this track, but also how unison is fulfilling. The guitar is making the same line as the vocals, that complement with small modulations that give a lot of feeling to the track. It’s uplifting music.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Mabe Fratti](https://mabefratti1.bandcamp.com/) - Aire
Sarah: **"**From Mabe's 2021 album [Será Que Ahora Podremos Entendernos](https://tinangelrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ser-que-ahora-podremos-entendernos). Spellbinding and blissful, this album features many glorious collaborations, but I kept returning to this track :) The power behind this cello is carried higher still by the ethereal vocals and synths, created an intoxicating melange of sound. I love how gracefully (and naturally) dissonance is incorporated into the overarching harmonies before taking control of the song by the end. A masterpiece of an album.**"**

## [Wau Wau Collectif](https://wauwaucollectif.bandcamp.com/album/yaral-sa-doom) - Thiante
Sarah: **"**From an [album/project](https://wauwaucollectif.bandcamp.com/album/yaral-sa-doom) that I adore :) such a cheerful quality to this horn section alongside the guitar riffs and wanderings. Songs like these set up sunshine for the rest of your day.**"**

## [Mamman Sani](https://mammansani.bandcamp.com/) - Samari Da Yan Matan
Sarah: **"**Mamman Sani, hailing from Niger, is a pioneer of synth music in West Africa. This track comes off of his [unreleased tapes](https://mammansani.bandcamp.com/album/unreleased-tapes-1981-1984) (circa 1981 - 1984). I love the influence of traditional folk music that swirls along Sani's modern synths. There's also a yearning quality to this organ melody, so special.**"**

## [Lucky Lo](https://www.instagram.com/luckylomusic/?hl=en) - Supercarry
Sarah: **"**Could not get this 2021 single out of my head :) Love the movement within this song, especially with these whirlpool arpeggios. A nice Sunday track to finish off our episode :)*"** 

<p id="outroduction"> That's all for this morning! Hope we got you to dance around a bit :) Many thanks to [Mabe Fratti](https://mabefratti1.bandcamp.com/) for her fantastic Sunday selections and to [Julie Wo](https://www.instagram.com/julie_wo/?hl=en) for her brillant illustration!</p>
