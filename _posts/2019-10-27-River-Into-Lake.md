<p id="introduction">This morning, please welcome Jermango Dreaming and his popping selection as our guest for this episode. 
<br><br>
Jermango Dreaming is the project of Jermaine Sakr, an Australian artist making dreamy pop music, groovy and laid back. 
This selection is both melancholic and upbeat. It is pure and feels whole. With days becoming colder and shorter, use this selection to help you embrace it. It is the remedy to autumn blues, a soft musical sweater that will bring heat to your heart. Feel everything but don't forget to leave room to dance a little bit. <br><br>

# River INto Lake's selection

## Column – Sensuela
_Jermango Dreaming_: **"**Just like every song off this album, Sensuela has the ability to turn any bad/sad mood around. It has been my go-to song to get me through the loss of lovers and the death of friends. It has helped me fall asleep and encouraged me to get up and start my day.**"**

## Poison Abbey – Upmarket
_Jermango Dreaming_: **"**This is the kind of song that could be played on a dancefloor or a Sunday morning kickback and equally fit the vibe – which is my main approach to writing music. Every synth part is perfect, and the vocals take you through the clouds.**"**

## Men I Trust - Numb
_Jermango Dreaming_: **"**What is not to love about this track? Listening to this is what I imagine those anti-anxiety blankets feels like wrapped around you sitting in front of a fire with your warm beverage of choice.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jermango Dreaming - Breeze
_Inès_: **"**I discovered Jermango Dreaming through [Hector Gachan](https://www.mailta.pe/289/hector-gachan/)'s selection, with 'I Want You', a beautiful ballad. The rest of his tracks are usually more upbeat, and this one is a perfect example. It is a breath of fresh air, a soundtrack for walks that make you feel better, a great chill song.**"**

## Shane Tyler - Lemurian Promenade
_Inès_: **"**Signed on the same label as our guest this morning, Shane Tyler is the bassist and founder of Gardens & Villa. He created this song as an ode to feeling things outside the human experience and being open to hidden teaching and realms. It sounds like sunlit pop, effortlessly cool.**"**

## Domenique Dumont - Sans cesse, mon chéri
_Inès_: **"**The most blissful track. It feels the summer version of Jermango Dreaming's description of the Men I Trust track. So calming, like sitting in front of the beach and emptying your brain.**"**

## MUNYA - Dove
_Inès_: **"**Ahhh so much love for this track. I become a big fluffy marshmallow when I hear it. My heart melts and everything becomes pink. It feels like going through the first layer of clouds when taking off on a plane. The cutest song and perfect ending for this episode.**"**
