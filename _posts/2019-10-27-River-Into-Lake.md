<p id="introduction">This morning, nature speaks to us: it bewitches us with its orange and brown leaves, it pushes us to get up early to go in search of mushrooms, chestnuts... And in this almost magical setting that nature offers us, the music of [River Into Lake](https://www.facebook.com/riverintolake/)ricochets on the water of streams and trees. 
<br><br>
On this beautiful autumn Sunday, Brussels is being honoured. Behind [River Into Lake](https://soundcloud.com/humptydumptyrecords/sets/river-into-lake-let-the-beast-out) is Boris Gronemberger, a talented multi-instrumentalist who has already collaborated with the [Girls In Hawaii](https://www.girlsinhawaii.be/), [FrançoiZ Breut](https://www.facebook.com/francoizbreut/) and V.O. What a surprise with this first album "Let The Beast Out", which promises us synthetic sounds, pop with a touch of rock as we like them!<br><br>

# River Into Lake's selection

## Timber Timbre – Velvet Gloves And Spit
_River Into Lake_: **"**That's a song i could play first on a sunday morning to wake up slowly, drinking coffee and watching the clouds go by. This song is part of my favourite [Timber Timber's](https://www.timbertimbre.com/) album 'Sincerely , Futur Pollution'.I love it because of its synthetizers 'sounds and moods from the 80's. It brings me at the back of my parents'car, when i was a child and when we drove on a highway.**"**

## [Selda Bağcan](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selda_Ba%C4%9Fcan) – Dostum Dostum
_River Into Lake_: **"**I love the way she sings, she could make me burst in tears. I saw her live a few month ago, it was so beautiful to see this 70 years old women being on stage with so much energy. For some reasons her music but also other turkish or oriental musics go deep into my heart.I have been listening lots of oriental music during the writing process, i was mainly listening to the website [radiooooo.com](http://radiooooo.com/), they have lots of amazing treasures from Syria, Egypt or Lebanon from the 50's, 60's, 70's. **"**

## [Thundercat](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundercat) - Them changes
_River Into Lake_: **"**I just discovered him on a friend's playlist. I really like his music, it's fresh and it sounds to me like a mix between stevie wonder and the beach boys who i like a lot. It also brings me back in late 90's when i was listening a lot to funk music.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [River Into Lake](https://www.facebook.com/riverintolake/) - Dig Your Own Way
_Anaïs G_: **"**An 8-minute song can seem long sometimes... But this one is the exception! It is so punctuated by auditory surprises and different musicals, that we remain stuck in the face of so much creativity and talent. We don't know where River Into Lake wants to take us through this music but what is certain is that we follow them with our eyes closed. Worthy of a soundtrack from the ["Stranger Things"](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things)series! **"**

## Chassol – Birds, Pt. I 
_Anaïs G_: **"**It's soft, majestic, as if we were in the middle of a dream. Carry in the forest in the middle of trees and birds. It's just us and nature... And the music of [Chassol](http://www.chassol.fr/). Powerful, touching, beautiful, light... There wouldn't be enough adjectives to describe the emotions I have while listening to this song. **"**

## Helado Negro - 2° Dia
_Anaïs G_: **"**It is with her sensual voice that [Helado Negro](http://heladonegro.com/) knows how to charm me, musically speaking. I fall under the spell of his pop music by this singer who came straight from Brooklyn. This title dates back 4 years already, but I couldn't resist sharing it with you. I invite you to listen to his latest album "[This Is How You Smile](https://heladonegro.bandcamp.com/album/this-is-how-you-smile)" released earlier this year.**"**

## Rozi Plain - Symmetrical
_Anaïs G_: **"**The indie folk of [Rozi Plain](http://roziplain.co.uk/), a Winchester native, made me spin, gave me a smile just by listening to this song. In her latest opus "[What A Boost](https://roziplain.bandcamp.com/album/what-a-boost)" released last avirl, she offers us an incredible palette of music by adding jazzy notes like the sunset I'm admiring right now. Warm and subtle!**"**
