<p id="introduction">This morning, la nature nous parle: elle nous envoute avec ces feuilles aux couleurs oranges et marrons, elle nous pousse à nous lever tôt pour aller à la recherche de champignons, de châtaignes... Et dans ce décor presque magique que la nature nous offre, la musique de River Into Lake fait des ricochets sur l'eau des ruisseaux et sur les arbres.

# River INto Lake's selection

## Timber Timbre – Velvet gloves and spit
_River Into Lake_: **"**That's a song i could play first on a sunday morning to wake up slowly, drinking coffee and watching the clouds go by. This song is part of my favourite Timber Timber's album ' Sincerely , Futur Pollution'.
I love it because of its synthetizers 'sounds and moods from the 80's. It brings me at the back of my parents'car, when i was a child and when we drove on a highway.**"**

## Selda Bagcan – Dostum Dostum
_River Into Lake_: **"**I love the way she sings, she could make me burst in tears. I saw her live a few month ago, it was so beautiful to see this 70 years old women being on stage with so much energy. For some reasons her music but also other turkish or oriental musics go deep into my heart.I have been listening lots of oriental music during the writing process, i was mainly listening to the website radiooooo.com, they have lots of amazing treasures from Syria, Egypt or Lebanon from the 50's, 60's, 70's. **"**

## Thundercat - Them changes
_River Into Lake_: **"**I just discovered him on a friend's playlist. I really like his music, it's fresh and it sounds to me like a mix between stevie wonder and the beach boys who i like a lot. It also brings me back in late 90's when i was listening a lot to funk music.**"**
