<p id="introduction">This morning, we're starting our day with [O'o](https://o-o-music.bandcamp.com), a Barcelona-based duo of French musician Victoria Suter and Mathieu Daubigné. Their music is filled with many references to the non-human, both in their lyrics and sound.
<br>
As I was listening to their selection and preparing mine during a stroll in the woods, I asked myself "What if it was time to de-center our attention and imagine a world where human is not at its center anymore?" I invite you to meditate on it while listening to this episode.</p>

# O'o's selection

## [Jockstrap](https://jockstrapmusic.bandcamp.com/album/i-love-you-jennifer-b) - Concrete Over Water
O'o: **"**We both like very much the universe of Jockstrap, a surprising mosaic of different musical genres.
"Concrete Over Water" is a good example. It starts as a ballad but throughout the track, we go from softness to chaos, from electro-banger to slow piano ballad ... It's quite a fascinating track that shakes up and breaks the codes.**"**

## [Sofie Birch](https://sofiebirch.bandcamp.com/) - Humidity
O'o: **"**It's hard to choose only one piece of Sofie Birch. Her universe is full of organic sounds, field recordings, and luminous melodies that incite dreaming.
"Humidity" begins with soft, shimmering chords, then blooms into a singing arpeggio. We hear birds singing, we are plunged into a tropical, humid world... Then, after a rise of saxophone a little ghostly, all stops abruptly. It is very beautiful.
Fan also of his very ASMR album, in collaboration with Antonina Nowacka, whose voice reminds the muffled and crystalline sound of the singers of the beginning of the 20th century.**"**

## [Darkside](https://darkside.bandcamp.com) - I'm the Echo
O'o: **"**Darkside, the perfect duo composed of Nicolas Jaar and Dave Harrington whose first album Psychic is a major influence in our work with O'o.
On the track "I'm the echo", extracted from their second album Spiral, we groove on a tribal rhythm, it is very sexy. We are particularly sensitive to the treatment of Dave Harrington's guitar during the climax of the track, which has the art of oscillating between classic sounds and effects that bring a lot of modernity.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [O'o](https://o-o-music.bandcamp.com/) - Spin
ImaCrea: **"**I love how the lyrics are composed with words bouncing from one line to another. Their debut album, [Touché](https://o-o-music.bandcamp.com/album/touche-2), is a trip to an exotic and wild landscape filled with imaginary creatures. There's something from Björk in this particular track I find.**"**

## [Patricia Wolf](https://patriciawolf.bandcamp.com) - Woodland Encounter
ImaCrea: **"**Patricia Wolf mixes field recording with dreamy synths. Her latest album, [See Through](https://patriciawolf.bandcamp.com/album/see-through), is a dose of rejuvenated energy only one can find out of the city.**"**

## [Boards Of Canada](https://boardsofcanada.bandcamp.com) - Oscar See Through Red Eye
ImaCrea: **"**Boards of Canada is one of my favorite bands of all time. And this track is one of my favorite tracks from them. It's like a secret potion to me, when I need to feel in the woods but I'm stuck in the city, I listen to this and then. I teleport.**"**

## [Bing & Ruth](https://bingruth.bandcamp.com) - We Are On the Side of Angels
ImaCrea: **"**This track best listens anywhere. Have great headphones and unveil the wonder in every landscape.**"**

<p id="outroduction">And that's it! As always, thank you for joining us. Our kindness and respect to O'o for their delightful Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Julie Wojtczak](https://www.instagram.com/julie_wo/) for this episode's wonderful illustration!</p>
