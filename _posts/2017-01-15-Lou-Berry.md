<p id="introduction">This morning, feel the wind and light, wake up slightly for a musical and sensual journey with [Lou Berry](https://www.facebook.com/IamLouBerry/?fref=ts "Check his Facebook page folks !"). As a young Parisian producer, his curiosity and taste for life offered him many thrilling inspirations while his music travels between Soul, Electronic, Jazz and Funk, never forgetting to be groovy and authentic. As he likes to say, his songs are a picture of his thoughts and emotions so get ready to escape in the blue sky of his mind...

# **Lou Berry’s selection**

+ ## A dreamy Sunday morning: Floating Points - Myrtle Avenue
_Lou Berry_: **"**Floating point’s slow chords and rhythmic progression takes you to another world on a Myrtle Avenue… If you’re too lazy to go anywhere today because you experienced a hard Saturday evening, your mind will travel at least!**"**

+ ## A joyful Sunday morning: Hiatus Kaiyote – Molasses
_Lou Berry_: **"**An inspiring harmonic trail, a musical story I really like to get through while waking up, which is a magnificent way to set in a good mood for the day!**"**

+ ## An exotic sunday morning: Balla & ses Balladins – Paulette
_Lou Berry_: **"**If you’re searching for some roots from somewhere else to begin the day, you’ll be glad to hear this beauty I fell in love with, made in Ghana.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Lou Berry – Blue Sky feat. Eylia
_Laura_: **"**The perfect song to peacefully wake up to on a wintery Sunday morning and let your mind fly away. It’s the ideal blend of Jazz, Funk and Soul music on a slow tempo with a subtle groove. The song that made me love Lou Berry's work and believe that his journey will be rich and captivating.**"**

+ ## Ravyn Lenae – Mr. Sun
_Laura_: **"**A young American artist, Ravyn Lenae attracts us into her soulful and sunny world. Mr. Sun is imbued with nostalgia, at the crossroads of Nu Soul and Ambient Hip-hop music.**"**

+ ## Duñe & Crayon – Blue Window
_Laura_: **"**A peaceful and sensual fusion of Soul and Electronic music from two talented Parisian DJs on the brilliant Roche Musique label.**"**

+ ## Alina Baraz & Galimatias – Make You Feel
_Laura_: **"**A passionate and intense song that intertwines the ethereal voice of Alina Baraz, a singer from Cleaveland and the dreamy melody of Galimatias, a Danish producer. This duo always creates a unique sound, light and incredibly elegant, one of the few I can listen to on and on.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks ! Thanks to [Lou Berry](https://soundcloud.com/hugod-1 "Lou Berry's Soundcloud") for his participation and Anaïs Marthe for the illustration. Have a dreamy Sunday but don’t forget to come back down to earth at some point! </p>
