<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome saxophonist and flautist, [Tamar Osborn](https://tamarosborn.com/), who leads the seven-piece horn-led collective, [Collocutor](https://collocutor.uk/), in the vanguard of London’s thriving music scene.</p>
<p>Their compositions draw inspiration from the many genres encountered over the course of a varied career, ranging from jazz, afrobeat, Indian classical and Ethiopian roots to polyphonic choral music and minimalism—the link being primarily modal music with a transportive effect.</p>


# Eric Chenaux's selection


## Martin Arnold – Stain Ballad
_Eric Chenaux_: **"**[Martin Arnold](https://soundcloud.com/martinarnold) makes some the best music of the 20th and 21st century and I could have chosen any number of his pieces but the memory of hearing the premier of Stain Ballad in London, played by [Apartment House Ensemble](http://www.apartmenthouse.co.uk/), was one of the latest reverous epiphanies I have had listening to Martin's music. **"**

## Allison Cameron – Tree Ferns (Live Performance by Wiek Hijmans)
_Eric Chenaux_: **"**[Allison Cameron](http://allisoncameron.com/) musics  for ensembles are uncanny, wild and beautiful but I am choosing this strange bird for solo guitar as she has a singular knack for writing for solo instruments.**"**

## Linda Catlin Smith – Moi Qui Tremblais
_Eric Chenaux_: **"**I have been listening to [Linda](http://www.catlinsmith.com/)'s music all winter, especially two recent CDs published by [Another Timbre](http://www.anothertimbre.com/index.html). Moi Qui Tremblais plays (maybe trembles) so strangely in the margins between the waking and dreaming world. Sweet listening.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Eric Chenaux – There's Our Love
_Sanjay_: **"**'Slowly Paradise' is [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/)’s new solo record—a collection of songs guided by soothing, buttery singing and bent, fried fretwork. Melody descends out into improvisation, leaving a haze of wah pedals, loose strums and electronics that float on the surface like glints of sunlight on a dewy morning.**"**

## Tashi Dorji – Karma Lata
_Sanjay_: **"**[Tashi Dorji](https://tashidorji.com/)'s music is at once frenetic and tranquil, but it's tranquility I'm concentrating on here with this track from the 2015 split LP with Marisa Anderson. It's a rolling and meditative five minutes that cycles its way around an abstract melody with clipped harmonics and stuttering fret work.**"**

##  Marisa Anderson – Into The Light
_Sanjay_: **"**This is a composition from 'Representing Birdsong'—a collaborative project inspired by birdsong between sound and visual artist [Lucy Stevens](https://lucystevens.co.uk/), tabla player [Rishii Chowdhury](https://twitter.com/tablarishii) and sitar player [Roopa Panesar](http://www.roopapanesar.com/). Recorded in Swithland Wood in Leicestershire, UK, they explore the sounds of bird vocalisations—including the variations in pitch, repetition and duration—by fusing field recordings, musical improvisation and drawing techniques. Check out more of the [Swithland Wood Recording Project](https://representingbirdsong.wordpress.com/).**"**

## Cara Stacey & Shh..Art Ensemble – Come Near Me
_Sanjay_: **"**The closing track this morning is a dedication to pianist Cecil Taylor who passed away on April 5th. Co-written by vibist Earl Griffith, 'African Violets' is a slow ballad that highlights both players' sense of melody. The piece unfolds fairly traditionally and Cecil Taylor's extremely unique harmonic style works nicely behind Earl Griffith's melody and his own soloing. In [the words of Alexander Hawkins in April's issue of The Wire](https://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/essays/alexander-hawkins-cecil-taylor), "Cecil Taylor always represents the playful and the unpredictable. His work can be by turns brutal and romantic. It has austerity, and yet is streaked through with glee and mischief. He is one of the masters at structuring an hour of music; but listening to his encores: did anyone ever structure the single minute with such devastating beauty?"**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
