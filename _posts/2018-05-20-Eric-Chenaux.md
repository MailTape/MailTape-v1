<p id="introduction">Close your eyes and float away in a blissful auditory dream courtesy of Paris-based guitarist, [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/). He provides us with a sweet Sunday morning glimpse into Canada's contemporary music milieu.</p>
<p>In his own music, melodies are teased out, textures repeat and the tempo often remains a leisurely stroll as he muses over motifs—love, moonlight, longing, intimacy, interdependence.</p>


# Eric Chenaux's selection


## Martin Arnold – Stain Ballad
_Eric Chenaux_: **"**[Martin Arnold](https://soundcloud.com/martinarnold) makes some the best music of the 20th and 21st century and I could have chosen any number of his pieces but the memory of hearing the premier of Stain Ballad in London, played by [Apartment House Ensemble](http://www.apartmenthouse.co.uk/), was one of the latest reverous epiphanies I have had listening to Martin's music. **"**

## Allison Cameron – Tree Ferns (Live Performance by Wiek Hijmans)
_Eric Chenaux_: **"**[Allison Cameron](http://allisoncameron.com/) musics  for ensembles are uncanny, wild and beautiful but I am choosing this strange bird for solo guitar as she has a singular knack for writing for solo instruments.**"**

## Linda Catlin Smith – Moi Qui Tremblais
_Eric Chenaux_: **"**I have been listening to [Linda](http://www.catlinsmith.com/)'s music all winter, especially two recent CDs published by [Another Timbre](http://www.anothertimbre.com/index.html). Moi Qui Tremblais plays (maybe trembles) so strangely in the margins between the waking and dreaming world. Sweet listening.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Eric Chenaux – There's Our Love
_Sanjay_: **"**'Slowly Paradise' is [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/)’s new solo record—a collection of songs filled with soothing, honeyed singing and bent, frazzled fretwork. On this track, the melody dissolves into improvisation, leaving a haze of wah pedals, loose strums and electronics that float on the surface like glints of sunlight on a dewy morning.**"**

## Tashi Dorji – Karma Lata
_Sanjay_: **"**[Tashi Dorji](https://tashidorji.com/)'s music is at once frenetic and tranquil. But it's tranquility I'm concerned about this morning with this track from the 2015 split LP alongside Marisa Anderson. It's a rolling and meditative five minutes that cycles its way around an abstract melody with clipped harmonics and stuttering fret work.**"**

##  Marisa Anderson – Into The Light
_Sanjay_: **"**[Marisa Anderson](https://marisaandersonmusic.com/)'s fourth album sounds like one long ride into the sunset. Otherworldy landscapes and deft playing aside, this title track is a dark reverie that sounds both foreboding and delicate, like wind rustling through leaves under a full moon.**"**

## Cara Stacey & Shh..Art Ensemble – Come Near Me
_Sanjay_: **"**Founded as a string quartet in 2014 in Cape Town, [Shh..Art Ensemble](http://shhart.com/) is now a flexible configuration of players including strings, vocals, electronics and a range of Southern African instruments. Originally recorded by Massive Attack and Ghostpoet, this composition—arranged by [previous MailTape guest Cara Stacey](https://www.mailta.pe/247/cara-stacey/)—sounds so relaxed yet casually surreal, as if lying awake beneath the stars.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
