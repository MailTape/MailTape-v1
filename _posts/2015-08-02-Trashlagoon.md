# Trashlagoon's inspiring selection :
 
## Floating Points - Myrtle Avenue
Trashlagoon: **"**I think there is no appropriate way to describe his awesomeness. The most interesting pieces of music are indescribable to my opinion. Give it a listen, make yourself comfortable and enjoy this
masterpiece.**"**

## Shigeto - Ann Arbor Part 3 & 4
Trashlagoon: **"**An ode to his hometown Ann Arbor continued on „Lineage“ (Ghostly International) in 2012. He continues his groundbreaking Ann Arbor Part 1 & 2 Series by using his Rhodes Piano in an virtuosic
way. This is electronic jazz music.**"**

## Gold Panda - Reprise
Trashlagoon: **"**This production proves that one vocal sample can make a song. Reprise has a huge built-up that continues with the most chilled groove i’ve ever heard. It even doesn’t need a basedrum to do his magic.**“**
