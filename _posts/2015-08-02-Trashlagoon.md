<p id="introduction">This Sunday, [Trashlagoon](https://www.facebook.com/trashlagoon), comprising of the German duo Sebastian Welicki and Niklas Freund will take on itself to port you to their fantastic world of atmospheric soundscapes and melodies.</p>

# Sounds from Berlin

What makes Trashlagoon stand out is their modernistic approach to music. “Marouki Knows” is a song that helps you escape into a fairytale your mind fabricates out of thin air. The journey, though, short-lived leaves you wonderstruck while you make your way out counting stars in the firmament. The avant-garde electronic from Berlin promises the sound of the future. It’s rich in positivity and have what it takes to make a long lasting impression.

# Trashlagoon's inspiring selection :
 
## Floating Points - Myrtle Avenue
Trashlagoon: **"**I think there is no appropriate way to describe his awesomeness. The most interesting pieces of music are indescribable to my opinion. Give it a listen, make yourself comfortable and enjoy this
masterpiece.**"**

## Shigeto - Ann Arbor Part 3 & 4
Trashlagoon: **"**An ode to his hometown Ann Arbor continued on „Lineage“ (Ghostly International) in 2012. He continues his groundbreaking Ann Arbor Part 1 & 2 Series by using his Rhodes Piano in an virtuosic
way. This is electronic jazz music.**"**

## Gold Panda - Reprise
Trashlagoon: **"**This production proves that one vocal sample can make a song. Reprise has a huge built-up that continues with the most chilled groove i’ve ever heard. It even doesn’t need a basedrum to do his magic.**“**
