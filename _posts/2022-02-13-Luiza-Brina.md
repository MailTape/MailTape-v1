<p id="introduction"> The week can bring so much to challenge and test us. This Sunday, we offer a reprieve. Together, let's exhale all that the past days have brought onto our shoulders and ease into the morning with our dear guest [Luiza Brina](https://luizabrina.bandcamp.com/).
<br><br>
Brazil based multi-intrumentalist Luiza Brina's dreamy selection seeks to soothe and soften us, providing some moments of healing for a gentle morning, much deserved :)
</p>

# Luiza Brina's selection

## Dea Trancoso - Tupinambá
Luiza Brina: **"**This song is on Déa Trancoso’s debut album, Tum Tum Tum. She’s an amazing artist born in the Minas Gerais State, just like me. The album was released in 2006, and the tracklist is a result of a research she made about popular culture from Vale do Jequitinhonha, where she’s from.

Tupinambá is my favorite song off of the album, it’s just very powerful, and I also love the density of the guitars' arrangement and of the precious voice overtures.**"**

## Jennifer Souza - Oração ao Sol
Luiza Brina: **"**Oração ao Sol is on Pacífica Pedra Branca, the latest studio album by Jennifer Souza (Moons), who was also born in Minas Gerais. Jennifer is an incredible singer-songwriter. I admire her work since she was part of the band Transmissor ‒ a band that’s a partner of Graveola, my own band.

I like to think of music as a prayer (“oração”) ‒ I’ll even release an album with prayers and songs later this year. Oração ao Sol is one of the most beautiful songs I’ve heard recently, and has the participation of the incredible Bahian Tiganá Santana.**"**

## Helado Negro - Thank You Forever
Luiza Brina: **"**I really love Helado Negro’s work, and, to my delight, we’ve been chit chatting for some time through social media. Besides being such a great songwriter, Helado is a super artist, who works also with sound art, experimental music, installation and performance. It’s truly amazing how all these elements are present in his work.

Thank You For Ever is a gorgeous song off of his latest album, Far In, released last year.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Luiza Brina - Somos Só
Sarah: **"**Such a beautiful release featuring Ana Frango Elétrico and Marcelo Costa. Brina's vocals surround the mix with an entrancing velvet quality. Love the steadiness of the guitar strumming, it gives the vocals all the space that they demand. A favorite from Brina's most recent releases.**"**

## OKI - Kai Kai As To (Rippling Lake)
Sarah: **"**Such a healing track, just like a rippling lake :) this entire album is such a wonder to listen through, each track offering something new and surprising. Love the bird vocalizations halfway through.**"**

## Jesse Adelman - Big Spaceship
Sarah: **"**What a dreamy embrace this song makes for us. Such a marbled texture of sound, with Adelman's grounded vocals streamlining through all of it.**"**

## Luiza Brina - A Toada Vem É Pelo Vento
Sarah: **"**A vibrant track to finish off this soothing Sunday selection :) Wonderful bass underscoring, adding such a driving momentum to the rest of the track's movement. The vocals contributes a somewhat dreamy haze, but with such a rousing instrumental section surrounding it**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to Temple Rat for her dreamy Sunday selections, and many thanks to Meriam Kharbat for this episode's stunning illustration !</p>
