<p id="introduction"> This morning, let's ease into the day with our dear guest [Luiza Brina](https://www.instagram.com/meiyuxinmay).
<br><br>
Mei, who started producing and performing music under her moniker Temple Rat in 2015, grew up near the vibrant megacity of Chengdu. At the age of 9, she began to learn the traditional Chinese Erhu, a mysterious two-stringed folk instrument made from carved wood and snakeskin, played with a bow. Through her years in Chengdu Mei was inspired by her passion for the city’s hyped underground electronic music scene and eventually started to fuse traditional Chinese folk music with minimalistic techno tunes.
<br><br>
Today with Mei’s groovy selection, we cast away the misty, chilly air for a moment, and step inside the warm greenery that’s filled by a nostalgic sunbeam.

# Luiza Brina's selection

## Dea Trancoso - Tupinambá
Luiza Brina: **"**This song is on Déa Trancoso’s debut album, Tum Tum Tum. She’s an amazing artist born in the Minas Gerais State, just like me. The album was released in 2006, and the tracklist is a result of a research she made about popular culture from Vale do Jequitinhonha, where she’s from.

Tupinambá is my favorite song off of the album, it’s just very powerful, and I also love the density of the guitars' arrangement and of the precious voice overtures.**"**

## Jennifer Souza - Oração ao Sol
Luiza Brina: **"**Oração ao Sol is on Pacífica Pedra Branca, the latest studio album by Jennifer Souza (Moons), who was also born in Minas Gerais. Jennifer is an incredible singer-songwriter. I admire her work since she was part of the band Transmissor ‒ a band that’s a partner of Graveola, my own band.

I like to think of music as a prayer (“oração”) ‒ I’ll even release an album with prayers and songs later this year. Oração ao Sol is one of the most beautiful songs I’ve heard recently, and has the participation of the incredible Bahian Tiganá Santana.**"**

## Helado Negro - Thank You Forever
Luiza Brina: **"**I really love Helado Negro’s work, and, to my delight, we’ve been chit chatting for some time through social media. Besides being such a great songwriter, Helado is a super artist, who works also with sound art, experimental music, installation and performance. It’s truly amazing how all these elements are present in his work.

Thank You For Ever is a gorgeous song off of his latest album, Far In, released last year.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Luiza Brina - Somos Só
Sarah: **"**theherthe**"**

## Li Daiguo - [All-Purpose Remedy for Indescribable Emotional Discomfort](https://parkerli.bandcamp.com/album/free-world-music)
Sarah: **"**Again, here we have a Chinese traditional folk instrument that meets electronic sounds. Spacey electro bleeps are joined by Li’s intricate Pipa plucking. Layers of buzzing drones, Li’s additional vocal, and collaborator Rick Parker’s eerie sound of a trombone, pushes the track into its climax. Li Daiguo is a Chinese-American multi-instrumentalist who mixes instrumentation—both Western and Eastern, traditional and contemporary—in a manner that’s uncomplicated yet thoughtful, his works always grander than their discrete elements suggest.**"**

## Laughing Ears - [Blue Dusk](https://laughingears.bandcamp.com/album/blue-dusk)
Sarah: **"**Laughing Ears is a Shanghai-based producer whom I’ve seen live for a couple of times in Shanghai. This track was the first I've listened to from her and remains my favorite among her stellar productions. The trance-infused, beautiful yet haunting synth line morphs like aurora, accompanied by insectile percussion and thrumming sub-bass. Truly mesmerizing.**"**

## Luiza Brina - A Toada Vem É Pelo Vento
Sarah: **"**A vibrant track to finish off this soothing Sunday selection :) This track's live performances have such contagious energy, especially considering the movement on stage of musicians. wonderful bass underscoring, giving a driving momentum to the rest of the track's movements 
the cello adds this vibrant complexity, 
beautiful voices, very involved; 
watching live performances of the track reveal 
the choir contributes a somewhat dreamy haze, but with a rousing instrumental and rhythm section surrounding it**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to Temple Rat for her dreamy Sunday selections, and many thanks to Meriam Kharbat for this episode's stunning illustration !</p>
