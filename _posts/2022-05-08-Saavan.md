# Saavan's selections
## Crayon - After the Tone (ft. Lossapardo)
Saavan: **"**This minimalist but impactful song is a collaboration between two french artists I really appreciate. Lossapardo also makes wonderful paintings that always take me to melancholic places just like this song.**"**

## Still Pigeon - Tippy Toes
Saavan: **"**A song tailored for a post-party Sunday morning…"Slip into my world, you'll land on soft pillows". I've discovered this song a month ago and I've been singing to it almost every morning since. Still Pigeon is a student band from London. I love the intimate touch of their sound mixed with softly spoken lyrics, warm guitar tones and the last saxophone part is a perfect way to end it.**"**

## J Lloyd - Stay Home With Me
Saavan: **"**This short piece by J. Lloyd, an artist from London, seems perfect for a cold Sunday morning… Those frozen mornings when the rain seems to whisper "stay home”. The haunting and fragile melody just makes you float.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Saavan - Running Short
ImaCrea: **"**A perfect dreamy pop soundscape by this great duo coming from the north of France. We can hear influences from Weval, Rival Console, The Blaze, and The XX. A cinematic track to put in your playlist for your next road trip. Don't miss their debut album, [Chapters](https://saavan.bandcamp.com/), to be released next month.**"**

## Maria Chiara Argirò - Greenarp
ImaCrea: **"**I love what's going on in this hypnotizing track. Not sure though how to describe it. If you read these lines, here's my invitation: write in the comment section how you'd describe it. I'm very interested in reading it.**"**

## 1981 Tokyo - Frontin' (Amapiano Edit)
ImaCrea: **"**This one inspires me to a cocktail made with strawberries and apple cider. I know it's Sunday morning but this sound is irresistible. Amapiano mixed with a classy loungesque RnB vibe. Put on your sunglasses and let's go outside for a walk.**"**

## Noname - Rainforest
ImaCrea: **"**Love song for the revolution.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our many thanks to [Saavan](https://saavan.bandcamp.com) for their smooth Sunday selection. Many thanks to Meriam for her surreal and poetic painting!</p>
