# Saavan's selections
## Crayon - After the Tone (ft. Lossapardo)
Saavan: **"**This minimalist but impactful song is a collaboration between two french artists I really appreciate. Lossapardo also makes wonderful paintings that always take me to melancholic places just like this song.**"**

## Still Pigeon - Tippy Toes
Saavan: **"**A song tailored for a post-party Sunday morning…"Slip into my world, you'll land on soft pillows". I've discovered this song a month ago and I've been singing to it almost every morning since. Still Pigeon is a student band from London. I love the intimate touch of their sound mixed with softly spoken lyrics, warm guitar tones and the last saxophone part is a perfect way to end it.**"**

## J Lloyd - Stay Home With Me
Saavan: **"**This short piece by J. Lloyd, an artist from London, seems perfect for a cold Sunday morning… Those frozen mornings when the rain seems to whisper "stay home”. The haunting and fragile melody just makes you float.**"**
