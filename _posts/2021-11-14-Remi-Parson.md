# Rémi Parson' selection

##  - 
Rémi Parson: **"**A pop kid at heart, my passion for ambient and instrumental music grew bigger and bigger over the last few years. Partly because of my work as a writer, as anything with lyrics will either be blocked from my brain or distract me too much, but also because I am a big fan of long, dismal, choral pieces such as this one. Extremely inspiring, whether it’s for the description of a sofa or my next song.**"**
