<p id="introduction"> This morning, We sneak into the city, at the first hour, with the partygoers coming back from their afternoons but also market gardeners preparing their stalls. Later in the morning, we get intoxicated by the smell of early morning coffee and the discussions of the little old people on the terraces of the cafés. It is with this emulsion of people on the move that we are driven to listen to Rémi Parson’s selection.
<br><br>
Rémi Parson, it’s the melancholy assumed with that hint of cold-wave to sublimate all that. It is with these two titles “Les sentiments” and “L'étranger”, that he pierces our hearts. Let’s remember that her next album “Pour un empire” will be released on November 19, under the label Isoola Records.

# Rémi Parson' selection

##  Joep Franssens - Harmony of the Spheres: First Movement
Rémi Parson: **"**A pop kid at heart, my passion for ambient and instrumental music grew bigger and bigger over the last few years. Partly because of my work as a writer, as anything with lyrics will either be blocked from my brain or distract me too much, but also because I am a big fan of long, dismal, choral pieces such as this one. Extremely inspiring, whether it’s for the description of a sofa or my next song.**"**

##  K. Leimer - All Sad Days
Rémi Parson: **"**A haunting and fragile melody, and this DIY spirit and idea of solitude that are so important to me. On my recent records, songs and sound have been somewhat more tidy, but playing live again will allow me to plug in my old machines and demonstrate my unique sense of rhythm and restraint with distortion, haha.**"**

## Lilian Becker - Cadendo
Rémi Parson: **"**If I had to choose, Italo disco, dance – or whatever you want to call it – would be one of my favourite kinds of music. To me it sounds so sincere and interesting. I love this idea of crafting ambitious pop songs with such weird and dark ingredients.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Rémi Parson - Les sentiments
Anaïs G: **"**A dark and cold melody, cold-wave tunes and it’s over. Rémi Parson has all this at the same time as a fearless race against time and the passing of life. And especially punctuated by feelings, always. . . We can’t wait to discover the other tracks of her new album “Pour un empire”, which is scheduled for release on November 19th, on Isoola Records.**"**

## Grand Parc - Sur les toits
Anaïs G: **"**We love this duo formed by Nicolas Marsanne and Annie Langlois. He offers us a deconstructed pop, adding electro using machines. A nice mix of genres all carried by French lyrics. A tip: go listen to their EP “Pull Noir” released in May 2020, you will enjoy this urban and hypnotic atmosphere.**"**

## Michel Gurevich - No One Answer
Anaïs G: **"**First of all, it was her voice that literally made me fall in love with this singer. His singular tone of voice mesmerized me. A walk like we love them, punctuated by nostalgia and mystery, combined with the industrial machinery used and the ambient hope. Perfect for Sunday morning!**"**

## Françoiz Breut - Juste de passage
Anaïs G: **"**An incredible universe and a favorite for this singer. My choice was on this track “Juste de passage” from his latest album “Flux Flou de la Foule. ” Poetic, touching words full of sincerity and emotion.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Our love to for Rémi Parson his eccentric and surprising Sunday selections, and many thanks to our very talented Camille Célestin for this episode's brilliant illustration !</p>
