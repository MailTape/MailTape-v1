# Bobun Fever's selection


## Rubin Steiner – Paradis
Bobun Fever: **"**Seventh Heaven in an arpeggiator sauce! Shimmery and limpid like a watermelon sugar coulis.**"**

## Richard Dawson – Weaver
Bobun Fever: **"**The most endearing and moving ogre of the British chanson. I love this surprising choir, together mystical and so joyful and stiring.**"**

## Cat Power – Sun
Bobun Fever: **"**I love the lyrics and the shiny and metal treatment of the voice on this tune by Cat Power. For me, it is a mystic invocation to active the inner Sun and burn all negative emotions of the week, beginning on Sunday with a great cleaning of the chakras for a day full of trust energy and abundance.**"**
