<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are optimistic, it is a new year full of hope and discovery. It's one of the MailTape crew's promises, more music, always with the desire to share new bands, and to kiffer your Sunday morning. To honour the year 2020, nothing better than Bobun Fever to put chilli instead of sugar in your coffee! 
<br><br>
Psychedelic, explosive, provoking. . . There are many other adjectives that could define Bobun Fever. Originally from Orleans, this musical hybrid takes us to their planet where celebration and sharing emotions are the order of the day. A moment of communion to be lived in concert.

# Bobun Fever's selection


## Rubin Steiner – Paradis
Bobun Fever: **"**Seventh Heaven in an arpeggiator sauce! Shimmery and limpid like a watermelon sugar coulis.**"**

## Richard Dawson – Weaver
Bobun Fever: **"**The most endearing and moving ogre of the British chanson. I love this surprising choir, together mystical and so joyful and stiring.**"**

## Cat Power – Sun
Bobun Fever: **"**I love the lyrics and the shiny and metal treatment of the voice on this tune by Cat Power. For me, it is a mystic invocation to active the inner Sun and burn all negative emotions of the week, beginning on Sunday with a great cleaning of the chakras for a day full of trust energy and abundance.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Bobun Fever - Happy Banana
Anaïs G: **"**From their latest EP "Bobun Fever", released in May 2019 is a concentrate of vitamins. You have to live the experience to understand it, their concert is an explosion of good humour!**"**

## Lachinos - Alas Rotas
Anaïs G: **"**Solar and psychedelic, this song is a breath of fresh air. This Franco-South American-Maghrebo-American group amazes us with their exoticism but also with a nice clip explaining the uprooting in a poetic way.**"**

## Cannibale - Do Not Love Me Too Much
Anaïs G: **"** **"**
