	Patchwork! This morning we offer you a fun activity with this new Sunday playlist. All you have to do is 1- settle into your best sofa, 2- plug in your headset (since this is the best way to listen a Mail Tape selection) and 3- start playback of today's episode. Well, actually it also works if you play it on your amp while you make yourself a coffee or you put on your running shoes. We are not sectarian at Mail Tape. All means are good to swallow your rations of good vibes.
<br><br>Then, the game will be to identify all the sonorities proposed in the following seven tracks. Be careful, some are subtly hidden in the middle of melodies that are sometimes raw, sometimes light, sometimes behind several layers that could not be more obvious... You will probably not be able to uncover them all from the first listen, but we trust your expert ears to find your way in this musical mosaic made of flashy and varied colors.
<br><br>We owe this where’s Wally/Waldo? (où est Charlie en français) of a somewhat new genre to our guest: Trifouille1er, whose electronic compositions are in the form of brightly colored stained glass windows. It's hard to miss his work as it detonates. However, for a few years now he has been working more or less discreetly, for a time alongside Cadillac, more recently featuring the Puppetmastaz, and throughout three EPs hidden somewhere on the Internet…
Will you be able to find them?

# Trifouille1er's selection

## Mauskovic dance band - Dance place garage

**Trifouille1er**: **"**I don't remember how I discovered Mauskovic dance band. I may have gotten there through the Meridian Brothers, or through Orchestra of Spheres, which I also love. It's a group from Amsterdam that makes super danceable music: it's a party. A successful fusion between very psychedelic things, latin influences, disco...**"**

## Siriusmo  - Always Du

**I've been listening to Siriusmo a lot for a few years now, and I still can't get enough of it. It's really the aesthetic of electronic music that I find myself deeply in. I’st super fine, and very fun. There are always little surprises, stupid sounds. You feel that he is someone who must have a lot of fun making his productions. There are always very nice harmonic atmospheres, it oscillates between sad nostalgia and very pushy things. Frankly, most of his tracks are little nuggets, and incidentally very good DJ tricks. Test them in club and tell me what you think. Oh, and it's so well mixed, the production is really very high quality, everything blends together really well. In short I'm a fan.**"**

## Ivy Lab - Cake

**Trifouille1er**: **"**Okay, there you have it, the biggest drop in the galaxy. It's very well done, and it always gives you chills. “Boy I gat my mind on cake” SPLLLAAAAA
First part of the song is super groovy, perfect for dancing any way. And the second is very beautiful, with well-felt little synth arpeggios, it's a 10/10. I really like this English and American bass music scene, which makes hip hop productions very "off beat", with unusual grooves. I'm thinking of Foreign Beggars, G Jones, Chee, Eprom, Little Snake, Two fingers...**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Trifouille1er - Bronto Porn

Anto: **"**Stay calm no stress, this song is a happy mess. And this is what we like about Trifouille's work. We think we're lost in the middle of a whole bunch of different sounds and yet there is an unstoppable groove that accompanies us throughout. It's impossible to be worried. We could let ourselves be destabilized by this feeling of dispersion, the fact that it goes in all directions, but instead, there is an overall coherence which is as tasty as it's brilliant. The kind of song that put a smile on your face from nowhere. Maybe it's this kind of carefreeness that seems paradoxically very diligent, or maybe it's the irresistible little touch of fun and stupidity that we can't help but love...**"**

## Patricia Taxxon – Gnaw

Anto: **"**Be ready, it is not impossible that one of the next episodes will be devoted to the universe of this artist in which it is difficult not to get lost. His latest EP was released two weeks ago, adding to the 75 others that we counted on his bandcamp (!!). Yes, she is productive, that’s saying something.
So the choice is yours, there is something for all tastes. Here, for example, with Gnaw, we have a slightly dark piece, which grabs us by the collar to slap us in the face a few times. It may seem violent but no, listen carefully, there is something hidden behind this apparent brutality.**"**

## Ko Shin Moon – Konyali

Anto: **"**This time we are going into an oriental delirium. The picture is different, it bursts with color, as if we were parading under the sun, in the middle of a foreign alley, with new instruments emerging from everywhere. It’s a celebration, everyone is laughing. We get lost in a joyful crowd where everyone plays their part, even the less virtuosos who just clap their hands. This track is made by a duo who mixes almost chemical synths with exotic traditional instruments to produce a large mosaic with a warm aesthetic.**"**

## Robert Le Magnifique – Reulf

Anto: **"**OK, I've been holding back for a long time not to put one of this genius artist's pieces somewhere, but it had to come out! Since we're talking about patchwork, Robert’s music is the very definition of variegated, even if it’s all within the same track. Reulf is the perfect example. There are scratchs, a few samples distilled here and there, very angry riffs and some notes that wander innocently as if they were saying "don't pay attention to everything around, follow us, take our hand and don’t let go of it under any circumstances.”
If anyone has Robert's number, send it to us. We are desperate to invite him for a further episode.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it, you rascals!
You’re still here? Damn, we didn't manage to sow you in the maze of the different universes that we crossed this morning.
Many thanks to Meriam for her inspiration on this wonderful illustration. Thanks to Trifouille1er for playing along and offering three tracks so stylish. Thanks also to ImaCrea for the technical help. This episode is one of the beautiful things that can result of a humble collaboration between enthusiasts fellows.
See you next Sunday!</p>
