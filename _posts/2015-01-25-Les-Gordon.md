<p id="introduction">This Sunday, we bring you an amalgam of ambient  and downtempo with our newly found French artist, [Les Gordon](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/pages/Les-Gordon/279442925425521 "Les Gordon on Facebook").
This entrancing selection gives you a look at how Downtempo has nestled itself among a wider audience while artists like [Les Gordon](https://soundcloud.com/les-gordon "Les Gordon on Soundcloud") tinker with their tools to ensure that we get only the best of their genres. 
<br><br>
On the other side, it is not only writing that  creates imagery; the opening track “Imagined Herbal Flows,” will help you form the perfect imagery you haven’t imagined yet… the rest is all yours to discover. That said, we wish you a very good morning and hope you have a good day ahead. </p>

# Les Gordon's morning inspiration
<br>

## Imagined Herbal Flows - Clouds
_Les Gordon:_ **"**I discovered this song by chance, by browsing Soundcloud ! I really appreciated the mix between Chill and Asiatic samples. By the way, this song is very pleasant to listen to while driving.**"**
 
## 123Mrk - Pleasure
_Les Gordon:_ **"**The only french guy signed on Future Classic. He is an artist to discover for people who don’t know him yet. I think he is also a forerunner of sounds of the Future.**"**
 
## Marika Hackman - O'Come, O'Come, Emmanuel
_Les Gordon:_ **"**The song evokes all the grace of this artist which I have been following from her first EP. I really encourage people to discover her work and talent.**"**
