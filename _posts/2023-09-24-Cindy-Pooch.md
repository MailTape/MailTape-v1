# Cindy Pooch's selection

## Masma Dream World - Knight Wolf

**Cindy Pooch**: **"**I met Devi, aka Masma Dream World in Brussels this year, when doing a vocal performance at Kanal-Centre Pompidou, for a Nyege Nyege event. She was also doing a performance, and it was really powerful. She’s a healer, she uses vocals, electronic music and her body for healing.

I really look up to her, and she inspires me in my own healing journey through music. She released her album, « Play at night in 2020 ». Like in this song, Knight Wolf, her experimentions are vibrant, transformative ! It takes me from within. Her music is really an energetic and somatic experience.

She’s american with Gabonese and Singapourian origins, and I think I also deeply connect to her through that place of hybridation, that is for me an amazing and precious place to create from.
**"**

## Esperanza Spladind - Formwela 1

**Cindy Pooch**: **"**I discovered Esperanza Spalding’s Songwrights apothecary lab (S.A.L) not long ago. It’s a experiment that led to an album with songs to accompany healing processes. It’s a transdiciplinary project because the research was made exploring musicianship, healing litterature, therapeutic practices...

Each song is composed to product a specific effect on the listener.

I’ m obsessed with « Formwela 1 », the opening of the album. This specific piece was « designed for memorizing, then hearing internally (via audiation) as an aide to self-soothe during an acute moment of stress in the home. ». It works with me.
**"**

## Janelle Monae : Babopbyeya

**Cindy Pooch**: **"**I remember discovering Janelle Monae’s album « The ArchAndroid » at a time when I met a lot of vocalist and musicians, and hanged out almost only with them, sharing what we loved. I was trying to discover my voice in a context where I could see that some conventional way of singing were valued by a majority around me.

And then I discovered Janelle Monae and I remember how moved I was by the uniqueness of her voice, the way she sung, how passionated she was. And I completely fell in love with that song.

It is a whole world, a whole story, a movie, with differents chapters. It has so much freedom, yet it is so solemn! The range of emotions is amazing, from passion to sadness, dispair and joy and crazyness. This song is always a marvelous journey for me. I deeply love it.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Cindy Pooch - Le Sang

ImaCrea: **"**It wasn't easy to choose a track from Cindy Pooch's first EP, [Issemou](https://cindypooch.bandcamp.com/album/issemou). Each of them unfolds a micro universe of intricate tales of wonder, to the point that it has influenced the way I've been listening to it since its release. Instead of listening to the entire album, I've been playing certain tracks on repeat on specific days depending on the flow of the moment. As I was making this selection, I felt that this one touched me more deeply at that moment. I think I appreciate the powerful imagery it evokes through its title, both spiritually and organically.**"**

## Matthew Halsall - Calder Shapes

ImaCrea: **"**I discovered Matthew Halsall through an episode that Julien made with him as a guest way back... 9 years ago (!) in our [150th episode](https://www.mailta.pe/150/matthew-halsall/). So, I've been following his music for quite a while now, and you can imagine how happy I was when I found out he had just released a new album recently, titled [An Ever Changing View](https://matthewhalsall.bandcamp.com/album/an-ever-changing-view). Since then, I've been listening to it, especially during my trips on the subways, and it makes every moment magical. I have to say, September has been quite intense, and his music has helped me navigate it smoothly.**"**

## Anohni - It Must Change

ImaCrea: **"**Cindy Pooch's selection revolves around different artists who all have in common beautiful voices. So, after Matthew Halsall's track, I thought I needed to play the game and go with an inspiring voice. Anohni struck me instantly, such an intriguing voice and with great company on her new album recently released, [My Back Was A Bridge For You To Cross](https://anohni.bandcamp.com/album/my-back-was-a-bridge-for-you-to-cross-2). Another gem, filled with pure sensitivity and love.**"**

## Natural Wonder Beauty Concept - Driving

ImaCrea: **"**NWBC is DJ Python and Ana Roxanne. They released this summer one of the most interesting electro albums I've come across recently. Thought it'd be great to end with this nonchalant track, perfectly suited for a walk outside, wether it's sunny or rainy.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thank you for joining us; let's keep discovering great music. Much love to [Cindy Pooch](https://cindypooch.bandcamp.com/album/issemou) for her inspiring selection. And many thanks to Camille Lemeunier for her striking illustration. See you next Sunday.</p>
