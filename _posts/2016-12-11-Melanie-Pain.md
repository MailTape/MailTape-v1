<p id="introduction">This morning,</p>


# **Mélanie Pain's selection**

+ ## Tortoise & Bonnie 'Prince' Billy - Thunder road
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**Amazing cover of  Bruce Springsteen with the noisy sound of Tortoise and the pristine voice of  Bonnie Prince Billy. A bizarre and powerfull mix that works really well. Springsteen lyrics are wonderfull.**"**

+ ## Iron & wine - A boy with a coin
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**A classic Iron and Wine song that is soft and strong, a beautifil folk ritournelle that sticks in your head for days. Love the rythm of that song.**"**

+ ## Team Ghost - The Riser
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**it's dark, melancholic, electro, noisy, it's like a soundtrack for the end of the world or for it's beginning... I can't wait to hear the new album of Team Ghost**"**

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## Mélanie Pain - Lèvres Rubis
_Louise_: **"****"**

+ ## Gordi - 00000 Million
_Louise_: **"**Hell yeah! Yes, all the way. I'm a big big fan of Bon Iver, so I'm really picky about covers of their songs. Yet, this one by Gordi hit me. So powerful to do it a capella. It blown me away.**"**

+ ## Christian Löffler - Nil
_Louise_: **"**One of the best albums of this 2016's end. I listened to it a lot since it came out and I'm not bored yet. **"**

+ ## Tom Misch & FKJ - Losing My Way
_Louise_: **"****"**
