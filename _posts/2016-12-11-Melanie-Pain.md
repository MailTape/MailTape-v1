<p id="introduction">This morning, we will enjoy a tasty breakfast prepared with love by our guest Mélanie Pain. The more I listen to French music that comes out theses days, the more I'm proud of the artists we have. Mélanie Pain is one of them.
Her new album, 'Parachute', came out in October. She unveils her fears and thoughts with such poetry, it made me shiver. Today's tape is full of surprises and risks.</p>

# **Mélanie Pain's selection**

+ ## Iron & wine - A boy with a coin
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**A classic Iron and Wine song that is soft and strong, a beautiful folk ritournelle that sticks in your head for days. Love the rhythm of that song.**"**

+ ## Tortoise & Bonnie 'Prince' Billy - Thunder road
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**Amazing cover of Bruce Springsteen with the noisy sound of Tortoise and the pristine voice of Bonnie Prince Billy. A bizarre and powerful mix that works really well. Springsteen lyrics are wonderful.**"**

+ ## Team Ghost - The Riser
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**It's dark, melancholic, electro, noisy, it's like a soundtrack for the end of the world or its beginning... I can't wait to hear the new album of Team Ghost.**"**

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## Mélanie Pain - Lèvres Rubis
_Louise_: **"**This piano, this voice and this chorus. It stays with me for nights and days. Mélanie Pain really deserves your attention. Go listen to 'Parachute'.**"**

+ ## Gordi - 00000 Million
_Louise_: **"**Hell yeah! Yes, all the way. I'm a big big fan of Bon Iver, so I'm really picky about covers of their songs. Yet, this one by Gordi hit me. So powerful to do it a capella. It blown me away.**"**

+ ## Christian Löffler - Nil
_Louise_: **"**One of the best albums of this 2016's end. I listened to 'Mare' a lot since it came out in November, at least 50 times, maybe more. Not bored of it, yet. Amazing to travel to, Christian Löffler's music is pure grace.**"**

+ ## Tom Misch & FKJ - Losing My Way
_Louise_: **"**Theses guys. You might know them already since we did MailTapes with both. When this track came out, I was on fire. So much great stuff in a four minutes song. They seem so chill at what they do. Talent, ladies & gentlemen, talent...**"**
