<p id="introduction">This morning, we are back after three month of absence for your great pleasure.  When I discovered [Oldtoy](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oldtoy/178600688976243), on a late night of August, my mind got instantly submerged in an undescriptible emotion. I’m happy to introduce his universe to you this morning and hope it will inspire you too.</p>

# Oldtoy, an humble music lover...

"Nothing interesting” that’s what Hugo Machenaud, aka [Oldtoy](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oldtoy/178600688976243),  answered me when I asked about his career in music. Obviously sharing the modesty common to many talended artist, he has nonetheless starded something very intriguing on [his Soundcloud profile](https://soundcloud.com/oldtoy). His wide inspiration floats from Gold Panda to Bonobo. Recording every sound himself, he manages to create a unique atmosphere along his productions. Working on his debut EP, he’s definitely part of our young talents watchlist. Not bad for an old toy.


# Oldtoy's selection

+ ## Four Tet - She Moves She
_Oldtoy_: **"**I think this will be the track I'll hear just before I die, watching at my life story. The first time I've listened to it, I was about 16/17 and I didn't have any particular interest in electronic music. It was a musical shock when I heared the chords joining this acoustic drum sample from the begining, and staying there till the end of the track. It is full of sadness and hope, something mystic is hiding there. Sometime this melody goes around in my head without even having listened to it since a long time. This album is part of my life, the best from Four Tet and of the 2000's decade. Perfect for a solo listening."**"**

+ ## Musicbox - November
_Oldtoy_: **"**A track for people who like subtle music. Among the great discoveries I made randomly on the internet there is Musicbox and their track November. What a surprise it was ! The music is millimetered like a mood vector, the sound processing is clearly original. It remains as a reference in Folktronica, a shame these guys are forgotten over time. It gave me energy and a positive vibe for the whole day.**"**

+ ## Gold Panda - Long Vacation
_Oldtoy_: **"**Listening to it in loop, I've been fascinated for a long time by this track. This industrial rythm is something great and crazy I wish I knew how to create. Sweet and hard, dreamy and rough, it is a must for dreamers. I tend to support less what he produced this year even if his Trust EP caught me right in the heart. I keep being a fan of Gold Panda, especially for his debuts.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks, it was a great pleasure to be back with you this morning and I’m eager to read your comments and get your feedback about this morning episode and our new version. Love.</p>
