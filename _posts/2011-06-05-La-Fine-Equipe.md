<p id="introduction">This morning, [La Fine Équipe](https://www.facebook.com/lafineequipebeats/) are off to a great start with Stevie Wonder who lights up our bedroom early in the morning as the first sunbeams. Off to take a shower listening to Amon Tobin, water dripping from the shower head in slow-motion and our skin feels every drop of it. Time passes, we don't know since how long we have been under the hot water stream. Back to reality, Madvillain sets his rythmn, his flow, it's time to brew some coffee.</p>

# The Great Escape

John Williams takes place by our side and gently opens a hidden door from where an intense light spring from. Thundercat is here, sitting on a a cloud floating in the air and hold out his hand as an invitation. We hear a dull sound in the distance like an approaching helicopter: the cloud dissipate, the fall is abrupt. The world is now in 2D, we are carried to an Aspirin's Super Mario version, from blocks to mushrooms we dive into the first found pipe. Pixels pass before us giving way to hot sand, the sun dazzle us. A strange sensation in our hair, we find sunglasses on our head. The smoked glasses unveil a wild crowd around us ready to party all summer to Classixx's track.

# La Fine Équipe's dope selection : 

## STEVIE WONDER - Living for the City
_oOgo_: **"**If I have to name only one track, I would say "Living for the City" by Stevie Wonder. For me, it's the perfect balance between emotions and groove, the melodies are splendid and every two bars, there's a chorus!
Actually, I find Stevie's music really powerful, it's a universal music both really accessible and really refined, which is rather uncommun.**"**


## AMON TOBIN - Slowly
_Blanka_: **"**I love this son and the atmosphere it brings out. Also, it's the music of a skate video I used to love at the time so it brings back lots of good memories.**"**


## MADVILLAIN - Figaro
_Chomsky_: **"**One of the biggest slaps in my face those past years was Madlib @ MF Doom's album, "Madvillain". It made me take a whole new shift in my musical course, if I have to choose one, I would say "Figaro".**"**

That's all folks, thanks to [La Fine Équipe](https://www.facebook.com/lafineequipebeats/) for their terrific selection.</p>
