<p id="introduction"> With lots of love, this morning we welcome Soren Song to MailTape. Based in Woodstock, NY, their work is tinged with striking emotional conviction and deeply perceptive lyricism. It's a true joy to welcome them for a collection of tracks to start your Sunday.
  <br><br>
They join us ahead of the release of their concept album, I'm. This work came out of what Soren describes as a moment of crisis that was at once an emotional breakdown and also a spiritual awakening. As they describe it, trauma has the potential to break people open and creative people create from such chaos. 
  <br><br>
  The release aims to rewrite Soren's understanding and imagery of their own core personal mythology. As they explain, many of the stories we are told and carry on to tell ourselves frame the worlds we live in, a reality that can be especially damaging when these stories are flawed or false in some way. This album aims to "fix" the stories Soren was told and to write a better story. Consequently, the work is a deeply tender and intimate collection of songs that seek to find truth and construct a new scaffolding of stories.</p>

# Soren Song's selection

## Over the Rhine - Poughkeepsie
Soren Song: **"**When I was a freshman in college I was sitting on a bench alone. A girl I'd just met sat down next to me and was listening to a discman. She told me I needed to hear this new song that had just come out by a band called "Over the Rhine" that no one seemed to know about. I'd never been someone who knew about a cool band no one knew about so I was very intrigued. The album was called "Good Dog Bad Dog" and the song was "Poughkeepsie". It changed everything for me. I had just begun writing songs a few months before but hadn't performed in front of anyone yet. I was raised in a very strict religious cult and hadn't heard anything but old hymns and hip hop for the most part up until that point. Hearing someone sing so beautifully and delicately about depression and things I was very familiar with at the time was incredibly healing for me. It absolutely informed what I did musically from that day forward and still informs what I do to this day. This album became one of my all-time favorites in no time and I've been following the band for 25 years now.**"**

## Sean Rowe - I'll Follow Your Trail
Soren Song: **"**This is one of the few songwriters I've heard in the past couple decades that immediately let me know he could hang with any of the masters of my youth. His voice alone is worth the price of admission and the melody is absolute understated perfection but the subject matter - a song to his child - is deeply impactful and got me quite emotional. I imagined my father singing something like this to me and it was far from the experience I had in my real life. I got to imagine what that safety and security might feel like and gave me hope that I could offer the world more than I was given.**"**

## The Beatles - A Day In The Life
Soren Song: **"**The Beatles - I know. For me, it was a different journey that got me to them. I was barely aware of their existence growing up and never heard their music. I remember seeing memorabilia of the four "mop tops" in a shop at the mall and that was about all I knew of them. At home, I was not allowed to listen to "secular" music which, for those who don't know, is anything that isn't the very specific music sanctioned by my church. I lived in a very urban area and only heard hip hop and R&B outside of the home. My senior year in high school, after getting in trouble in public school, I was forced to attend a small, almost entirely white and suburban Christian school. It was a nightmare of abuse but the good that did come of it was driving in a car and hearing "A Day In the Life" for the first time. I couldn't imagine anything else in life being more important than what was happening in that moment. When the song finished playing I asked what the hell I had just listened to. My new friend looked at me very strangely and said: "That was The Beatles. Do you really not know The Beatles?" From that day forward I did and The Beatles - John Lennon in particular - became the template for what to do in life. I started writing songs almost immediately.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Soren Song - Gentle Man
Sarah: **"**One of my favorite songs off of Soren Song's soon to be released concept album, I'm. Gentle Man was also the first track of Soren's I found :) Their voice is so powerful and full in this song, cut live to tape along with the studio's delightfully mellifluent Steinway D concert grand piano.

If you have any questions just don't ask them out loud 
examining gentleness, esp of man - taking what they want and what they can 
reinventing mythology of self
beautiful piano 
	funny juxtaposition in the video -- 
what if the shadow is really the shade
**"**

## Adelyn Rose - Gone for Anything
Sarah: **"**Really enjoying the releases from this Brisbane-based psychedelic rock/folk band, this one comes off their 2021 album [Passing Over](https://nicebiscuit.bandcamp.com/album/passing-over). The effect of this track is dizzying, love the intermeshed vocals and these the balance of rock and acoustic elements.**"**

## Soren Song - That Furious Rain
Sarah: **"**Another beautiful track of Soren's, this one the second to last track on their 2019 album, [Boundaries](https://sorensong.bandcamp.com/album/boundaries-explicit). **"**

## Rainbow Kitten Surprise - Polite Company
Sarah: **"**I like how the piano from That Furious Rain flows into the piano of this one -- the glory of the endless playlist :) This track has been like an old friend for years and it's my favorite from the RKS collection. The lyrics are so brutally tender, making the softness of the vocals somehow feel like a scream. The unrefined roughness in the production process also seems deliberate given the rest of How to: Friend, Love, Freefall's meticulous mastering. I like how you have to really listen for the lyrics to understand the song, maybe some things are too intimate to say your full chest.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up this morning's selection, what a journey it's been! As always, thank you for joining us.
