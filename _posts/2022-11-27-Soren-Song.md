<p id="introduction"> This morning, we're delighted to welcome Baby Chuck to MailTape for an eclectic Sunday selection. Based in Los Angeles, Baby Chuck (Matt O'Keefe) joins us a month after releasing his most recent album, [Warm Infinity](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/album/warm-infinity). The release explores and examines the essence of memories and the varied nostalgia that they bring.
  <br><br>
The album's songs feature four other musicians, with all tracks produced by Ryan Pollie. Several of the numbers are shrouded in a 70's AM Radio effect, placed wonderfully for the subject matter of increasingly hazy memories. Consequently, listening through the album feels like getting lost in a dream, suspended in time. As Baby Chuck explains, the album's deliberate delving into reverie feels necessary, not only to purge any lingering thorns, but to ground our perspective for the days ahead.</p>

# Baby Chuck's selection

## Over the Rhine - Poughkeepsie
Soren Song: **"**When I was a freshman in college I was sitting on a bench alone. A girl I'd just met sat down next to me and was listening to a discman. She told me I needed to hear this new song that had just come out by a band called "Over the Rhine" that no one seemed to know about. I'd never been someone who knew about a cool band no one knew about so I was very intrigued. The album was called "Good Dog Bad Dog" and the song was "Poughkeepsie". It changed everything for me. I had just begun writing songs a few months before but hadn't performed in front of anyone yet. I was raised in a very strict religious cult and hadn't heard anything but old hymns and hip hop for the most part up until that point. Hearing someone sing so beautifully and delicately about depression and things I was very familiar with at the time was incredibly healing for me. It absolutely informed what I did musically from that day forward and still informs what I do to this day. This album became one of my all-time favorites in no time and I've been following the band for 25 years now.**"**

## [Yves Tumor](https://yves-tumor.com/) - Secrecy is Incredibly Important to the Both of Them
Soren Song: **"**This is one of the few songwriters I've heard in the past couple decades that immediately let me know he could hang with any of the masters of my youth. His voice alone is worth the price of admission and the melody is absolute understated perfection but the subject matter - a song to his child - is deeply impactful and got me quite emotional. I imagined my father singing something like this to me and it was far from the experience I had in my real life. I got to imagine what that safety and security might feel like and gave me hope that I could offer the world more than I was given.**"**

## [MJ Lederman & Wednesday](https://mjlenderman.bandcamp.com/) - Phish Pepsi (feat [Advance Base](https://advancebase.bandcamp.com/))
Soren Song: **"**The Beatles - I know. For me, it was a different journey that got me to them. I was barely aware of their existence growing up and never heard their music. I remember seeing memorabilia of the four "mop tops" in a shop at the mall and that was about all I knew of them. At home, I was not allowed to listen to "secular" music which, for those who don't know, is anything that isn't the very specific music sanctioned by my church. I lived in a very urban area and only heard hip hop and R&B outside of the home. My senior year in high school, after getting in trouble in public school, I was forced to attend a small, almost entirely white and suburban Christian school. It was a nightmare of abuse but the good that did come of it was driving in a car and hearing "A Day In the Life" for the first time. I couldn't imagine anything else in life being more important than what was happening in that moment. When the song finished playing I asked what the hell I had just listened to. My new friend looked at me very strangely and said: "That was The Beatles. Do you really not know The Beatles?" From that day forward I did and The Beatles - John Lennon in particular - became the template for what to do in life. I started writing songs almost immediately.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Soren Song - Gentle Man
Sarah: **"**My favorite track off of Baby Chuck's album, [Warm Infinity](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/album/warm-infinity), though it was very difficult to choose (especially with tracks like [Treeshadows](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/track/surrender-anyhow), [Leavespeak](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/track/leavespeak) and [Surrender Anyhow](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/track/surrender-anyhow) in the mix). Love the horn section and piano backings here, they add such a timeless quality to the already nostalgic lyrics. Talking to Matt, he notes the strange process of reaching the essence of this memory, how so much time had passed and the edges of it softened, even becoming saturated (hence [the cover art](https://babychuck.bandcamp.com/album/warm-infinity)). He described how leaving the recording process felt like shedding an older skin, like the buckets of rainwater weighing down his memories were emptied and put back. Such a liberating way to finish an album.**"**

## [Nice Biscuit](https://nicebiscuit.bandcamp.com/) - Round and Round
Sarah: **"**Really enjoying the releases from this Brisbane-based psychedelic rock/folk band, this one comes off their 2021 album [Passing Over](https://nicebiscuit.bandcamp.com/album/passing-over). The effect of this track is dizzying, love the intermeshed vocals and these the balance of rock and acoustic elements.**"**

## [Sofie Royer](https://www.instagram.com/sofieroyer/?hl=en) - Schweden Espresso
Sarah: **"**The opening track of Sofie Royer's latest album, [Harlequin](https://sofieroyer.bandcamp.com/album/harlequin). Loved her club releases ([Leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLFMfc2QGKE), [Melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2NYBA4MfY0), [Cheerleader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsh4so-DjqM)) and her recent [feature on Toro y Moi's MAHAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vniX7UCBlNI). This album and the last present a completely different side of Royer, with old boogie grooves and silky vocals to match. [Harlequin](https://sofieroyer.bandcamp.com/album/harlequin) is worth a listen through this week, be sure to look out for tracks Ballad of Bobby Beausoleil and Someone is smoking (my favorites).**"**

## [JayWood](https://jaywood1.bandcamp.com/album/slingshot) - Shine (feat Mckinley Dixon)
Sarah: **"**The bass and 80's synths -- not sure if it gets better than this? JayWood's album [Slingshot](https://jaywood1.bandcamp.com/album/slingshot) is such an energizing listen, with tracks like [Pray, Move On](https://jaywood1.bandcamp.com/track/pray-move-on), [Just Sayin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6oLGwBNuyg), and [God is a Reptile](JayWood - God Is A Reptile (Official Video) - YouTube) joining some of the week's essential playlist additions. Basically all of them, the whole album, just listen to it the whole way through and bring your week from a 7/10 to a 10/10 guaranteed. Love the momentum in this track in particular, Jaywood is doing striking work in [the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMh8jR3L1MU), bringing an artistic perspective to police violence and activism; highlighting such power in his lyrics. Looking forward to what's next from him!**"**
