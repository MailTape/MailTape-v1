<p id="introduction">This morning, it's Valentine's day ... It wasn't planned to invite Pépite this particularly day but the band which composed the most beautiful love song of the year is our guest today! "Les Bateaux", a song that made me capsize. Completely upside down. A melancholic song about this guy, at the beach, who looks freighter boats further offshore, passing by the coast, as his past love. A redemption song which give me chills. </p>

# Melancholic dandies
 
Pépite is a two guys band. They sing about love, time and travels with such a melancholic way. The past is also everywhere in their songs. I don't think that means the past is more important than the present for them. But it seams that they only talk about the past as a huge force that you have to control to move on in order to embrace your future. You can travel around the world, you will not be able to go back in time. If "traveling always bring you back to the same shores" ("Les Voyages te ramènent toujours aux même rivages"), these same shores also can make you capsize. As trips and shipwrecks, the past make you what you are, and now deal with it, sing about it, build your future with it. 

# Talking about shores 

Talking about travel, heartbreaks, desire for sweet life, makes you want to go. Find out by yourself if, after the trip, the shores had changed or not, if it will make you capsize or not. As the perfect soundtrack of all initiatory trips, their organ filled songs which can lightly touch you and change your soul, like the elephant frightened by mice. 

Anyway, it makes me want to take you far away, to discover with you new shores. To sail away to rejoin the Londonian Reginald Omas Mamod IV in Cuba, then navigate to Brazil and meet Phillipi & Rodrigo (Fatnotronic) and finally passing by the Cameroun and listen Cerrone and Manu dibango tell you about frenetic love. And who knows? Maybe you’ll not see your departure shores like before…

# Pépite's selection :

## LA Priest  - Onio
Pépite: "This one is just the best track of the year, as a big fan of dub I can only bow to this song. The production is unbelieveable, lyrics too, and not to mention the solo at the end... The album is as good as this track, perfect for remembering last night and dance in the bed."

## Paul Hazan – Child of Nature
Pépite: "Paul Hazan is an old friend, he got a beautiful voice and his guitar/voice cover of the first version of "Jealous Guy is just perfect for sunday mornings. Especially that this version is quite rare."

## Flavien Berger – Life in a New Motion
Pépite: "This is a Poni Hoax's track which I love. Vibes are very glamor. [The clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxWMdCAwZs) is beautiful too. I discover this Flavien Berger's cover one year ago and I find it as good as the original, the mere act of having translated the lyrics gives another dimension to the song. And we don't often hear Flavien Berger singing like that, with just a piano. He has a great voice, and choirs are incredibly hypnotic !"
