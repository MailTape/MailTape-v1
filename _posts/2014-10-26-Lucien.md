# Autodidact grown-up forever kid

Loeffler started to play music by the age of 14. Living in a secluded region, lacking a musical surrounding, he had to teach himself the essentials of making electronic music. Before long he developed his own deep and moving sound, colored with a melancholic undertone music for both the soul & the body. He recalls a variety of music styles he listened to as a child and teenager that were highly influential to his own development as a musician.

# Lucien's morning inspiration
 
## Spooky Black - Reason
_Lucien:_ **"**Spooky Black aka Lil Spooky… I don't even remember how I found out about him. I checked out "Reason" video and completely got caught by his vibe: the shitty post-sovietic landscape, the VASELINE t-shirt, the jaded face and above all the awesome song!**"**
 
## V E S T I G E - wishuwerehere
_Lucien:_ **"**Super-refreshing tune! Vestige is from California, there's a strong Soulection element in his groove. Those guys changed the game, they created unexpected new bonds between genres…even if I don't really make this kind of music, this whole wave definitely switched something in my head as a producer.**"**
 
## Rubba - Way Star
_Lucien:_ **"**Some people need a big blunt before sleeping. I can't close an eye if I don't get my daily "Rubba" dose, it's my lullaby. This song from 1980 went under the light a few years ago, when Madlib sampled it for Freddie Gibbs's immense "Thuggin".**"**
