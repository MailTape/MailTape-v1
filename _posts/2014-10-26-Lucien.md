<p id="introduction">
This morning, discover [Lucien](https://soundcloud.com/luciennn "Lucien's SoundCloud"). Lucien is the founder of Ventura Records, a recently borned Parisian Label. Ventura tries to articulate its work around three principles: reflection, surprize and contemplation. And this is what this MailTape is all about.</p>
 
# Songs as paintings

If you do like abstract painting, you should like today's MailTape. Similarly to the slow process of an eye trying to get the essence of a painter's gesture and intention, songs will only reveal their true meaning if you do dare to pay appropriate attention to them. Now sit down, close your eyes and, happy contemplation!

# Lucien's morning inspiration
 
## Spooky Black - Reason
_Lucien:_ **"**Spooky Black aka Lil Spooky… I don't even remember how I found out about him. I checked out "Reason" video and completely got caught by his vibe: the shitty post-sovietic landscape, the VASELINE t-shirt, the jaded face and above all the awesome song!**"**
 
## V E S T I G E - wishuwerehere
_Lucien:_ **"**Super-refreshing tune! Vestige is from California, there's a strong Soulection element in his groove. Those guys changed the game, they created unexpected new bonds between genres…even if I don't really make this kind of music, this whole wave definitely switched something in my head as a producer.**"**
 
## Rubba - Way Star
_Lucien:_ **"**Some people need a big blunt before sleeping. I can't close an eye if I don't get my daily "Rubba" dose, it's my lullaby. This song from 1980 went under the light a few years ago, when Madlib sampled it for Freddie Gibbs's immense "Thuggin".**"**
