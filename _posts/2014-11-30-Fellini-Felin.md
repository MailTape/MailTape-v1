<p id="introduction">This morning, discover [Fellini Félin](https://soundcloud.com/fellinifelin "Fellini Félin's SoundCloud"). Everything started in the Fellini’s Club in Barcelona. We were in the 2000' and Sébastien Coutureau, together with a bunch of friends, decided to create his first band : Fellini. Ten years later, after the band had split up, Sébastien decided to start a solo project. Fellini Félin was born.</p>

# Blended genres make great vibes

His first EP, Wisteria, has recently been released on Délicieuse Records. Sébastien uses diffrent inspirations to create his own music such as disco, house and Afrobeat. His tracks are influenced by modern productions. Among them we can quote Kitsuné or DFA Records. Within a month only, his brilliant track "On the Way Home" had reached 120'000 plays on SoundCloud. Hope you'll enjoy his selection.

# Fellini Félin's morning inspiration
 
## Soft Rocks - Talking Jungle (Justin Vandervolgen Remix)
_Fellini Félin:_ **"**This disco-house production is 10 minutes long and I'm still not tired of listening to it! From beginning to end, I'm engaged by its rich and subtle details. I admire the execution of such varying elements and how the track progresses with a plethora of emotions.**"**
 
## Adam Kesher - Local Girl (The Shoes Remix)
_Fellini Félin:_ **"**I've been listening to both of these French artists since my adolescence. I find this particular remix of interest because it's more simple and melancholic than its original version. To me, this genre of music exudes honesty and spontaneity.**"**
 
## Tornado Wallace - Insect Overlords
_Fellini Félin:_ **"**I can't help but turn up the volume with this one! The synths, the percussion, everything is perfect. It captivates from the start and is the ideal track to play to get the party started!**"**
