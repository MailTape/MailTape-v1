</p>This morning  
<br><br>

# Dombrance's selection

## Pink Floyd – A Pillow Of Winds
Dombrance: **"**When you just woke up. Still in dreamy state. You watch a bird flying by the window with a nice coffee in your hand . David Gilmour is the god of steel guitar.**"**

## Dope Lemon – Hey You
Dombrance: **"**Finally you go back to bed for a little nap. Nothing’s better than this foggy song to back in Morphee's arms. Can’t stop listening to Dope Lemon’s last album.**"**

##  – 
Dombrance: **"**It’s time to prepare the breakfast. Can hear the kids laughing. Family time.
Andy Shauf is the best song writer a the moment. Love the vibe of this song with the « McCartney bass line »  seems easy but it’s not.**"**
