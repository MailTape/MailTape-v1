<p id="introduction">This morning, wake up with [Lockhart](https://soundcloud.com/lockhartlockhart "Lockhart's Soundcloud stream")'s vibrant selection and enjoy a great soundscape where pop and electronic will have you feeling like you can take on the world.</p>

# Sous le soleil exactement

Lockhart is the solo project of Nico Lockhart; a jack-of-all-trades french producer who has worked with several other artists and projects including writing and producing for Franklin's last album, remixing Odeï, My Broken Frame, Frank Rabeyrolles, [Brigitte (with Cardinale)](https://soundcloud.com/cardinale-1/i-want-your-sex-brigitte "Brigitte - Cardinale Remix on Soundcloud")...

By mixing lyrics in french and english, Lockhart is telling us stories with his feet in the sand, "sous le soleil exactement" like Gainsbourg sang... After having released his debut album in March 2014, which was named “Toi”, he went on a solo tour and since then, has been working on a new album to be released soon and is now playing live with a trio.

# Edyth's morning inspiration

## Kink - Express
_Edyth:_ **"**This that house track. The infectious groove that isn't needlesly heavy nor unnecessarily tamed by the typicalities of 'E.D.M.' This track proves that funk and raw dance potential isn't something that's mutually exclusive to sharp loud sound walls but to synchronicity and unique concepts. Basically train sounds is what we're talking about- I'm dancing to train house in the morning as I choo-choo myself to get my coffee and pit-pat this rythm for the rest of the day.**"**

## A/T/O/S - What I Need 
_Edyth:_ **"**Jazz. Yes, that's what this is. This is jazz. If you don't have it on that last day of the week then I will never believe you are a person that knows how to unwind. If you can't sink into your couch with a nice end-of the week drink then you haven't been grinding hard enough. Who knew fluttering pianos, burst drums and bass thumps being strobed at you can be so soothing. Maybe it's the vocals, sublime isn't enough of a word to describe them. Deep Medi can be surprising sometimes.**"**

## Fink - Sort Of Revolution
_Edyth:_ **"**When it comes down to it, I'm the biggest sucker for minimalist instrumentals and a heartfelt voice. The lyrics are vague but the place that it all comes from isn't- this track is a celebration of not being dead (Which is, incidentally, the only thing I tend to celebrate).**"**
