# **Dan Rico's selection**

+ ## Whitney - No Woman
_Dan_: **"** This track struck a strong chord with me the first time I heard it. I love the soothing/ambitious production using horns and strings. Brings to mind reminisces of road lust, wind dancing through fields of corn, reflections against car windows as the night cruises by--Prompts the coexistent feelings- loneliness and independence-- inspired by long, weary travels. **"**

+ ## Omni - Wire
_Dan_: **"**Out of high school I went through an intense Josef K phase. These guys are the answer to my post-punk prayers. Tight, angular guitar riffs interplayed with resolute, methodical bass lines and minimal, groovy drumming. On top of it a nonchalant croon reminiscent of the early days of the Strokes. There's something almost robotic about the character of this song until it breaks into the disco-punk chorus. And then your heart melts just a little. **"**

+ ## NoName - Diddy Bop (ft. Raury &Cam O'bi)
_Dan_: **"** This track takes me back to childhood summers in 90's Chicago. Extended stays with cousins, the "it takes a village" vibe of being raised and growing up. That and you can dance to it. There's been so much exciting hip hop coming out of Chicago lately and this is just one of many tracks you just hear and suddenly you think "Damn.. so good. **"**

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## Dan Rico - Soft Feeling
_Maxime_: **"**xxx**"**

+ ## Alex Izenberg - Grace xxx
_Maxime_: **"**xxx**"**

+ ## Chain Wallet - Shade
_Maxime_: **"**It getting could out there. This song is the perfect accessory to walk into the cold air, hands in your pocket. Weirdly, this band come from Norway. They know talking about. Sometime it'll look like cold wave, sometimes it definitly is a pure gold-pop song, it depends your mood. **"**

+ ## Kevin Morby - Beautiful Strangers
_Maxime_: **"**This one is a must-listen song. We already know that Kevin Morby is the little prince of american ballad song. This one look like an old and good Bob Dylan song. I'm assume the comparaison. It's a strong protest song, but formally soft in the ears. Words of Morby will be stuck in your head for a long time.   **"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all Folks! Thanks to Dan Rico for his selection and thanks to you for listening and follow us every Sunday morning. LOVE !</p>
