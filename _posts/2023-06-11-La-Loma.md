<p id="introduction">
	This morning... Oh wait ! It’s morning already ?
We didn't see it coming. It’s like we got stuck in that club, where we lived a thousand lives in a single night.
<br>
  From the frenzied rhythms that make you want to wring your neck in the middle of the crowd, to these kinds of pop songs that make us forget everything around and become teenagers again, passing through contemplative phases, where we have the impression of hovering in a cloud of smoke… This selection is a digest of all the emotions that we can experience during a club party with friends, with a crush (or ex-crush), with forbidden stuff, with a particular atmosphere that you only can feel in that place, and with music, of course !
	<br><br>
	Our guest for this episode is [Julia Bondar](https://juliabondar.bandcamp.com/). She just released a new EP made of 4 smashing tracks including a wonderful feat with Rebeka Warrior and « Tropic of virgo », a masterpiece, the eponymous song that ends the EP as one ends a sleepless night : happy and grateful for the beautiful moments that we lived.</p>

# Julia Bondar's selection


## [Luca Eck feat LVRA](https://soundcloud.com/iamlucaeck) – Hide

Julia Bondar: **"**I like how Luca super hardcore kicks and cheesy melodies. Yet it sounds fresh and modern. It makes me feel sassy and powerful.**"**

## [Clams Casino feat Lil B & Asap Rocky](https://clamscasinoofficial.bandcamp.com/) – Be somebody

Julia Bondar: **"**Once I was listening to a Spotify algorithmic playlist and this song popped up. I could not keep doing what I was doing. I had to listen to it to the end and then 100 times more. The tempo, the rap in its best tradition mixed with the shoegaze atmosphere created by Clams Casino. These tree characteristics fall into place together so beautifully.**"**

## [Ari Abdul](https://ariabdul.bandcamp.com/) – Hush

Julia Bondar: **"**I wish I would be so cool Are when I was 20. This girl makes me want to go back to my teenage years and make everything complicated again.
Too fall in love with a bad guy, wear black and pink and suffer.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Julia Bondar](https://juliabondar.bandcamp.com/) – Hell of ride

Anto: "Damn, this track makes me want to thrash around, toss my head around until it comes off my spine. Equipped with her machines, Julia Bondar throws us a piece that is both dark and luminous, an invitation to a rumble, as if the tune was challenging us, or provoked our bodies and wanted to force us to answer. Well, I don't need any more. You look for me ; you find me, I'm won't let it go, and I'm going to dance like crazy until the very end of the song."

## [Blaise Moore](https://soundcloud.com/blaisemoore) – Stutter

Anto: "Echoing Ari Abdul’s track, here is a piece that could be sung at the Super Bowl halftime show by Rihanna or any pop icon adored by the crowds.. But since it came out in the privacy of the indie Canadian community, it only has a few thousand views on youtube. Yet, this instru, this voice, this intention... We feel that the tune is made to hit his listener and come back haunting him night after night, in cursed dreams."

## [Fort Romeau](https://fort-romeau.bandcamp.com/track/the-zone) - Beings of Light 

Anto: "This is the opposite of the previous track. All the worries are gone, it's just us, and this music designed to make the crowd blubber. We cry while dancing, we hug, we love each other… We are alive!"

## [Dampa](https://dampa.bandcamp.com/album/color-blind) – Clubs

Anto: "And we end with a final effort. We don’t have a lot of energy anymore but whatever, we don't need. We just have to let ourselves be carried away by this deep beat, to follow the melodies that take us by the hand, and to listen to the advice that Djéla whispers in our ears with her half-sharp, half-bewitching voice. "Freeze the consequences!" she said. OK ! Never mind, it's already sunday morning and we dance again and again…"

<p id="outroduction">That’s all for us. We don’t know if we have to go to bed or if we will follow some friends on other adventures… Many thanks to Julia Bondar who accompanied us during a part of this crazy night and big up to Lucie for her sweet illustration.</p>
