  This morning, we're giving way to women, the real thing! Those who fight every
  day for their identity, for their race, for their history, for their rights...
  Those who proclaim it loud and clear through their music, their art and their
  passion. That's the one we're going to hear in this episode, or at least one
  of them: Aryane.

<p id="introduction">This morning, we're giving way to women, the real thing! Those who fight every day for their identity, for their race, for their history, for their rights... Those who proclaim it loud and clear through their music, their art and their passion. That's the one we're going to hear in this episode, or at least one of them: [Aryane](https://www.facebook.com/aryane.music/).
<br><br> 
A new breath of fresh air is what Aryane provides and that's what she presents to us under this new pseudonym. Something between rap and urban pop, assertive and yet mysterious.
</p>

# Aryane's selection


## [Lenny Kravitz](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Kravitz) - Believe in me
_Aryane_: **"**Even is this song is quite old, for me it is timeless.I love sweetness of the music,the sounds and the sensuality that emerge from this song.**"**

## [J. Bernardt](https://www.facebook.com/JBernardtmusic/) - Calm Down
_Aryane_: **"**J.Bernardt is an artist that i discovered randomnly, while chilling on the web. I felt in love with his musical universe. I could have quoted his title "Wicked street", but it is my monday title so i had to choose another one to be compliant with this exercise.**"**

## [Teni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teni_(singer)) - Case
_Aryane_: **"**I love his tone form Teni. His sounds take you back is a fascinating and different universe. I find it rather cool and adapted to that moment in your sunday, when you want to move, but you're not really to do so. It brings you to dancing step by step, and i find Teni's voice adn tone really captivating.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Aryane – Le Secret
_Anaïs G_: **"**It is easy to identify oneself through one's words. Yet, very personal but so much speaking for each and every one of us "[Le Secret](http://smarturl.it/aryanesecretsingle?fbclid=IwAR1d0fttEaBocwe7-tiJ63TbHB7LOaRhxxv_pS2wmqC2v4V_JE13lR_b7Kw)" is the first title of an EP planned for 2020. An artist to follow very closely! **"**

## [George Ka](https://www.facebook.com/georgekamusique/posts) – Saigon
_Anaïs G_: **"**Committed and feminist, she delivers a powerful message about her origins, her cross breeding and her identity. A very beautiful message that makes us aware of the complexity of the thing. A revelation, a nugget of French rap!**"**

## [Yseult](https://www.facebook.com/YseultOfficiel/) – Rien à prouver
_Anaïs G_:**"**Highlighted by the singer [Angèle](https://www.facebook.com/angeleouenpoudre/) during her opening act, she quickly established herself with such power and elegance that one remains speechless in front of her music. With extreme strength and sensitivity, she plunges us into her world where she counts her success but above all the vision of the daily life of a black and round woman. A successful gamble for this young singer who never ceases to amaze us!**"**

## [Pumpkin](https://pumpkinisorange.bandcamp.com/) & Vin'S da Cuero – Science Friction feat. Sly The Mic Buddah
_Anaïs G_: **"**If I had to remember one rapper in particular, it would be her. I think Pumpkin was the first French rapper I ever listened to. An incredible flow, a chillax touch that no one can match. In "Science Friction", released in 2016 on her EP "[Chimiq](https://store.mentalow.com/album/chimiq-ep)", she protests against violence against women by their husbands. A sad reality that is still being debated and which unfortunately is still relevant in 2019!**"**
