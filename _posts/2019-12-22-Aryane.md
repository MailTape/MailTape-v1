<p id="introduction">This morning, we're giving way to women, the real thing! Those who fight every day for their identity, for their race, for their history, for their rights... Those who proclaim it loud and clear through their music, their art and their passion. That's the one we're going to hear in this episode, or at least one of them: Aryane.


</p>

# Aryane's selection

## Lenny Kravitz - Believe in me
_Anaïs G_: **"**Even is this song is quite old, for me it is timeless.I love sweetness of the music,the sounds and the sensuality that emerge from this song.**"**

## J. Bernardt - Calm Down
_Aryane_: **"** **"**

## Teni - Case
_Aryane_: **"** **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Aryane – Secret
_Anaïs G_: **"** **"**

## George Ka – Saigon
_Anaïs G_: **"**Committed and feminist, she delivers a powerful message about her origins, her cross breeding and her identity. A very beautiful message that makes us aware of the complexity of the thing. A revelation, a nugget of French rap!**"**

## Yseult – Rien à prouver
_Anaïs G_:**"**Highlighted by the singer Angèle during her opening act, she quickly established herself with such power and elegance that one remains speechless in front of her music. With extreme strength and sensitivity, she plunges us into her world where she counts her success but above all the vision of the daily life of a black and round woman. A successful gamble for this young singer who never ceases to amaze us!**"**

## Pumpkin & Vin'S da Cuero – Science Friction feat. Sly The Mic Buddah
_Anaïs G_: **"**If I had to remember one rapper in particular, it would be her. I think Pumpkin was the first French rapper I ever listened to. An incredible flow, a chillax touch that no one can match. In "Science Friction", released in 2016 on her album "Chimiq", she protests against violence against women by their husbands. A sad reality that is still being debated and which unfortunately is still relevant in 2019!**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to Aryane for her Sunday selections, and [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/?hl=fr) for her brilliant illustration!</p>
