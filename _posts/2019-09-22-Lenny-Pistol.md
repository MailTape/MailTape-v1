# Lenny Pistol's selection

## Family Time – Magic Abys Hotel
_Lenny Pistol_: **"**I think "Family Time" is the most underrated band there is right now. This song in particular makes me think of "Tranquility Based Hotel and Casino" because it's classy and rock n roll all at the same time, but it sounds more DIY, less smooth than the Arctic Monkeys album. It makes you want to grow your hair and do nothing else than playing music with your mates. I find it really inspiring.**"**

## Arthur – Woof Woof
_Lenny Pistol_: **"**Arthur is the solo project of a guy from the indie band "Joy Again". His songs are usually really short and go straight to the point. What strikes me the most is that you can feel he comes from the pop music world, but he makes experimental songs. That's a weird blend I like.**"**

## Mac DeMarco – Freaking Out The Neighborhood  
_Lenny Pistol_: **"**This song has multiple secret layers. It's not the case for all DeMarco's songs, but I think this one can be read in a lot of different ways. That's why you can listen to it over and over again, and never get bored.**"**
