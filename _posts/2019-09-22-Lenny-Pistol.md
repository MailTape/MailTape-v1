<p id="introduction">This morning, we are entering a lovely and floating retro Sunday vibe. Fondling in vitamin induced subtilties, this selection of tracks will pull you out of this morning’s hazy fog. [Lenny Pistol](https://www.facebook.com/LennyPistol/) will be your guide for this morning’s episode. 
<br><br>
His off-putting and nonchalant unique musical style melted with hints of  Lo-Fi pop sounds well defines this young Belgian artist. Whether you appreciate his personality or not,  his music will propel you out of time, remolding your day.

# [Lenny Pistol's](https://lennypistol.bandcamp.com/) selection

## [Family Time](https://www.facebook.com/familytimeband/) – Magic Abyss Hotel
_Lenny Pistol_: **"**I think "Family Time" is the most underrated band there is right now. This song in particular makes me think of "[Tranquility Based Hotel and Casino](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquility_Base_Hotel_and_Casino)" because it's classy and rock n roll all at the same time, but it sounds more DIY, less smooth than [the Arctic Monkeys](https://www.arcticmonkeys.com/) album. It makes you want to grow your hair and do nothing else than playing music with your mates. I find it really inspiring.**"**

## [Arthur](https://plzmakeitruins.bandcamp.com/album/woof-woof) – Woof Woof
_Lenny Pistol_: **"**Arthur is the solo project of a guy from the indie band "[Joy Again](https://joyagain.bandcamp.com/)". His songs are usually really short and go straight to the point. What strikes me the most is that you can feel he comes from the pop music world, but he makes experimental songs. That's a weird blend I like.**"**

## [Mac DeMarco](https://www.facebook.com/MacDeMarcoBand/) – Freaking Out The Neighborhood  
_Lenny Pistol_: **"**This song has multiple secret layers. It's not the case for all DeMarco's songs, but I think this one can be read in a lot of different ways. That's why you can listen to it over and over again, and never get bored.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Lenny Pistol](https://www.instagram.com/lennypistolito/?fbclid=IwAR0IOt8VPxQeqGWRIaR5QR3FeDxqM14be7xyNg36_C8PfZykV3Ue-jgyGI0) – Despise
_Anaïs G_: **"**I discovered Lenny Pistol’s music through the [Luik Records label](https://luikrec.bandcamp.com/). Almost by chance, as I listened to various sounds, my ear was specifically drawn to his music. Through the often violent sounds of certain songs, his immediately seduced me. His first album, [« Pistil Boy »](https://lennypistol.bandcamp.com/album/pistil-boy-ep) out last February, is an explosive mix of gentleness and eccentrism.**"**

## [Julia Shapiro](https://twitter.com/cool__slut?lang=fr) – Natural
_Anaïs G_: **"**It’s natural, simple and beautiful, but quite far from being simplistic. [Julia Shapiro](https://juliashapiro.bandcamp.com/), the singer and guitar player of the group [Chastity Belt](https://chastity-belt.bandcamp.com/), reveals her feelings, her emotions, her pains through an indie rock sonority. Often flayed and melancholic but bearing an incredible light.**"**

## [daste.](https://soundcloud.com/daste-music) – Overload
_Anaïs G_: **"**The degree of sexiness of this song goes far beyond what we could possibly imagine. From a slight hip rocking, to the special note that will tinkle our ear. A gaze of a million words and a voice that strokes and shivers the whole of you. I shall let you enjoy this delight for yourself and will let you savor the ecstatic side effects.**"**

##  [Angelo De Augustine](https://soundcloud.com/angelo-de-augustine) – I Could Be Wrong 
_Anaïs G_: **"**It is quite by chance that I stumbled upon this song. d’Angelo De Augustine has a soft and melancholic voice. A minimalistic yet very intimate pop sound is what gives depth and sincerity to his music. As though, nothing ever really happens by chance !**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always thank you for listening. Much love and respect to [Lenny Pistol](https://www.facebook.com/LennyPistol/) for his selection, and to [William Girault](https://williamgirault.com/) for this gorgeous illustration. </p>
