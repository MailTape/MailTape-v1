  This morning, It's bright, soothing, calm. You can hear the birds, the wind
  creeping through your hair. . . Whether we're in the city, in the mountains or
  in the countryside, we need to disconnect, to escape information, to cut off
  time by an hour, a day or a weekend. With this selection made with Madjo we
  will escape our daily lives and fly away from all the hassles!

<p id="introduction"> This morning, It's bright, soothing, calm. You can hear the birds, the wind creeping through your hair. . . Whether we're in the city, in the mountains or in the countryside, we need to disconnect, to escape information, to cut off time by an hour, a day or a weekend. With this selection made with [Madjo](https://madjo.fr/) we will escape our daily lives and fly away from all the hassles!

# Madjo's selection

##  [Haley Heynderick](https://www.haley-heynderickx.com/)- The Bug Collector 
Madjo: **"**I’ve just discovered this artist and I really love her. It’s sweet and beautiful. It opens my days with gentleness. **"**

## [Black Sea Dahu](https://www.blackseadahu.com/) - My Guitar is too Loud 
Madjo: **"**This song is so beautiful and sad too because I think the singer wrote the song for her passed away dad however it gives me some powerful energies to begin my day. I love singing this song!!**"**

## [Òlafur](https://olafurarnalds.com/works/) Arnolds - Woven Song ([Hania Rani](https://haniarani.com/) - Piano Reworks)
Madjo:**"**The original song has been composed by Òlafur Arnolds. I’m in love with the sound of the piano, she plays with the piano pedal mute and It’s like she sings and plays just for us.. You can hear the movement of her hands when she plays, the sound of the petals. It's very intimate.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Madjo - Enfant Sauvage
Anaïs G: **"**Madjo's music is a concentration of emotions, sensibilities and powers brought together. At the time I loved his album "Trapdoor" where you can find "[Le nid des 100 soucis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqQ2hSEcVp0)" or "[Je claque des doigts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqOAB40IO1Y)". But also her song "[Choose The Heart](https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=4_dhEDem_6o)" with her clip in nature, surrounded by mountains, without forgetting the remix of this song made by the Fine Equipe. So I couldn't miss its new title "[Enfant Sauvage] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-htycI4gNg)". I find everything I love in this title: the sensitivity to what surrounds us and to this master nature, the power and grace of words with the bonus of a journey far from the cities and this life too fast. An escape to what could reconnect us to ourselves, is what Madjo offers us in this title but also in her future album "Rebellion". Special mention for the [live under the snow] version (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZRXURISrcU) which is thrilling!**"**

## [Patrick Watson](https://patrickwatson.net/) - Good Morning Mr. Wolf
Anaïs G: **"**I already knew the music of Patrick Watson but I was like pierced by it for 6 minutes. This song oscillates between calmness and calmness, the explosion of emotions and finally reveals something powerful and touching. A musical ufo, because it amazes us all along and surprises us until the last note.**"**

## [Rahill](https://rahill.bandcamp.com/) - I Smile for E
Anaïs G: **"**In the Sunday sunshine, we savour this nostalgic pop by plunging back into the clichés and old childhood photos, a bit like a "madeleine de Proust", Rahill amazes us with her softness and sensitivity. Special mention for the video of "[I Smile for E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dailZORx68Q)" graphic, colorful, familiar and soft! We look forward to the release of his solo album "[Flowers At Your Feet](https://rahill.bandcamp.com/album/flowers-at-your-feet)" on May 12th.**"**

## [Ezéchiel Pailhès](https://ezechielpailhes.bandcamp.com/) - Elégie
Anaïs G: **"**For the end of this playlist, nothing better than a few steps of dances, to boat with Ezéchiel Pailhès . Simple and touching words like a poet, he tells us his story with rhymes and words well placed on island dancing sounds! His album "[Mélopée](https://ezechielpailhes.bandcamp.com/album/m-lop-e)" is to be enjoyed without moderation, at any time of the day or night. **"**
