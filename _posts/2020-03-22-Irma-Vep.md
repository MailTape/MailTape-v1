<p id="introduction">This morning, we are stopping time with [Irma Vep](https://irmavepirmavep.bandcamp.com/). An episode a bit meditative and a bit hyper, to tune down the inner and outer turmoil. Dive into the quiet, embrace it if you can. [Irma Vep](https://irmavepirmavep.bandcamp.com/)'s selection will make you travel through endless dimensions. 
<br><br>
Irma Vep is the project of Edwin Stevens, artist from the UK that creates guitar-based, bold and complex tracks. They will release their new [album](http://www.gringorecords.com/releases.php?gringocode=WAAT072) on April 3rd.

# Irma Vep's selection

##  [Jon Collin](https://joncollin.bandcamp.com/)- Was That Me Part 2
Irma Vep: **"**Jon is possibly my favourite guitarist. He uses ebow, slides, rulers, knives, whatever, to create breathtaking structures. His records and performances are other worldly experiences that should not be missed. I've had the honour of touring and jamming with Jon for years now, but this was the first piece where I heard him layer his guitar and it really blew me away. It's a soaring, constant crescendo. Jon's subtle and considerate playing is on an emotional blast off and I love it.**"**

##  [Stephanie Hladowski](https://soundcloud.com/stephaniehladowski) - Andrew Lambie
Irma Vep: **"**This is one of my favourite songs ever. Its a traditional tune reworked into a beautiful one note droneathon with amazing playing by Chris and Stephanie Hladwoski. Both of them are super talented players. Taken from the High High Nest 10" EP on Singing Knives. Hunt it down if you can. It's worth it! Stephanie also made an amazing record with legendary hero C Joynes called The Wild Wild Berry thats amazing too. Wish I could hear more.**"**

## [Vibracathedral Orchestra](https://vibracathedralorchestra.bandcamp.com/) - If You Can't Smoke 'em, Sell 'em
Irma Vep: **"**Cob Records in Bangor (RIP) was a great record shop that I used to spend all my money in while I was in school and college. Alan Holmes who worked there got me onto the weirder improv stuff like Sunburned and No Neck Blues Band and I found Vibracathedral Orchestra through them. They're masters of the craft, the dons of droning, always weird and kind of fun. Every member of the group has their own projects that are all incredible too. Any of their jams could be on this list - this is just the latest one I've heard from an album I haven't got yet and is flipping amazing.**"**



# MailTape's selection

## [Irma Vep](https://irmavepirmavep.bandcamp.com/) - I Do What I Want
Inès: **"**I don't know how it does it, but this song fills me up so much. I have been listening to it for a bit now, and it has resonated with me in times when I needed it, like a motto pushing me to do that small thing I have been putting off out of fear. Building up then releasing, staying firm and strong.**"**

## [The Spirit of the Beehive](https://www.facebook.com/thespiritofthebeehive/) - Fell Asleep with a Vision
Inès: **"**This song is a fever dream that I am obsessed with. First time I heard it, I was half-listening to the album and this song completely snapped me out of what I was doing, leaving me feeling disoriented for a couple of minutes. The music fading in and out, the fast drums, the lingering and vaguely threatening sound in the background… genius.**"**

## [Arthur Russell](https://www.thegardenvadavada.com/) - This Is How We Walk on the Moon
Inès: **"**Beautifully still and a little bit bizarre, a suspended moment in time and space.**"**

## [Matthew Tavares](https://soundcloud.com/mattytavares) - Déjàvu
Inès: **"**It's one of those songs that make you forget their length. It layers on and on, makes you go through different paths, feeling like you've been listening to three different songs at the same time. Also, the album this track is from is purely amazing.**"**
