<p id="introduction">This morning, 
</p>

# Tite's selection

## Don Cherry - Luna Turca
Tite: **"**Perfect by it’s simplicity and Joy this song is also so naive that it’s kind of magic. Pure soul energy it’s a time for meditation and chanting. Contemplation Warm feeling like a wood fire camp.**"**

## Rydeen - Yellow Magic Orchestra
Tite: **"**A friend of mine sent me a playlist of Ryuchi Sakamoto’s music. I was with my daughter she instantly jumped around it was a magical moment because it’s yellow and because it’s an orchestra. Perfect for the sport performance running around the house.**"**

## Maître Gazonga - Les Jaloux Saboteurs
Tite: **"**What makes you happy in life? It's a sunday morning question. It's also the N'djamena blues. You can not be happier than being in N'djamena. That's why i'm gong there next week to meet wonderful musician.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Tite - Caché
Anaïs G: **"**Tite surprises us again with a title worthy of the 80s with synthesizers and electronic machines. “Hidden” is a mix of powerful industrial music, illuminated, mesmerizing and sexy at the same time. This song can be found on the new compilation of the label Tsunami Recording.**"**

## Zoé Couppé - Troisième Jour de Voyage
Anaïs G: **"**A discovery, freshness and lightness. A diary in music, which makes you want to listen to the perepities of Zoé Couppé to the sounds of the machines used. A surprising song that can be found on the “Premier Rayon” Compilation of the Soleil Rouge label!**"**

## Low Lov - Unknown Summer
Anaïs G: **"**Both transdisciplinary artist and musician, Low Lov embraces us in an intimate and cozy atmosphere, we are quickly swept away by her voice and this slow and jerky music tinged with a certain blackness.**"**

## Reminiscentia - Synergy
Anaïs G: **"**As Praktika did through a playist from MondElectronique, who highlights Urkainian artists, I also wanted to give voice to her artists. The choice was difficult, but I was transcended by the music of the band Reminiscentia. Their song “Synergy” took me back to the 80s, with the synth that reminds us of the band New Order. Other artists include: dakhabrakha, Alina Pash, Стасік, Tim Jackiw, Voin Oruwu, VovaZiLvova & Zbaraski, Bliad, Gogol Bordello, Stanislav Tolkachev, Recid, Vakula & Nevertii (feat Olena), Koloah, Closer, NECHTO Records..**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our thanks to Tite for this elevating electronic selection. Many thanks to Camille Célestin for this episode's wonderful illustration!</p>
