This morning, thanks to [Poom](http://poom.fr/), thou the Seine is still rising and we're all wondering what summer is supposed to feel like, this enchanting duo from Paris is taking us for a cruise of decadence around the flooded docks of a city struggling to see the light again.</p>

# Pacing the path

Like the single rose lingering around my table for the past two weeks, good things never die, especially if made and given with love. Of course, maintenance is key to any good relationship and that's why classics should always remain on your favourite playlist. The one you need, the one that feeds and serves as the magical umbrella to the melancholic humidity rain can spunge into you. Poom's music did just that for me. Their lyrics of the unconditional relationship that exists between man and pace is as clever as the symbols used in "De la vitesse a l'ivresse".
You'll almost feel like melting, even if your French is poor, this song is as universal as a shooting star. So make a wish, and let this MailTape carry you away to a land of musical abundance filled with the familiar roundabouts of old and new vibrations.

# Poom's selection:

## Air - Femme d’Argent

_Poom_: "A souvenir from adolescence, a song we used to listen to over and over, feeling small, but not so sad about it."

## Vulfpeck - Back Pocket

_Poom_: "Jack Stratton is the guy you want to be friends with : he looks like Steven Spielberg on a shooting day in the 80’s and his band Vulfpeck is one of the coolest thing there is."

## Joao Gilberto / Tom Jobim - Aguas de Março

_Poom_: "Tom Jobim is the sun, without him it would be cold and dark. Joao Gilberto is the sunglasses the sun passes through, so that you can enjoy it even more."
