<p id="introduction">Intro</p>

# Headline

Words...!

 
# Poom's selection:

## Air - Femme d’Argent
_Poom_: "A souvenir from adolescence, a song we used to listen to over and over, feeling small, but not so sad about it."

## Vulfpeck - Back Pocket

_Poom_: "Jack Stratton is the guy you want to be friends with : he looks like Steven Spielberg on a shooting day in the 80’s and his band Vulfpeck is one of the coolest thing there is."

## Joao Gilberto / Tom Jobim - Aguas de Março

_Poom_: "Tom Jobim is the sun, without him it would be cold and dark. Joao Gilberto is the sunglasses the sun passes through, so that you can enjoy it even more."

That's all folks, thanks to [Poom](https://www.facebook.com/Poomband/) for their magical selection.</p>
