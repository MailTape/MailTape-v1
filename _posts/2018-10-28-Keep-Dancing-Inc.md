  This morning, we welcome Louis, Charles, Gabrielle and Joseph from Keep
  Dancing Inc to turn this MailTape into a Sunday ode to pop music.  Formed in
  2014, the Parisian quartet released in June 2018 its second EP
  “Restructuration” on Un Plan Simple, where on the cover we can see a lonely
  photocopier on the dirty wine-red carpet of a random abandoned office. But far
  from the stiff world of impersonal open spaces and fake sick leave, Keep
  Dancing Inc’s music, lies somewhere between synth pop, new wave and cold zouk
  – it is warm and welcoming.

<p id="introduction">This morning, we welcome Louis, Charles, Gabrielle and Joseph from [Keep Dancing Inc](https://www.facebook.com/keepdancinginc/) to turn this MailTape into a Sunday ode to pop music.
<br><br>
Formed in 2014, the Parisian quartet released in June 2018 its second EP “Restructuration” on [Un Plan Simple](http://www.un-plan-simple.com/fr/keep-dancing-inc/), where on the cover we can see a lonely photocopier on the dirty wine-red carpet of a random abandoned office. But far from the stiff world of impersonal open spaces and fake sick leave, Keep Dancing Inc’s music, lies somewhere between synth pop, new wave and cold zouk – it is warm and welcoming.
And if you're nearby, you can catch them in London [tonight](https://www.facebook.com/events/2344989058907773/) and in Manchester on [Wednesday](https://www.facebook.com/events/944969792375494/)!</p>


# Keep Dancing Inc's selection

## [Porches](https://porchesmusic.bandcamp.com/) – Country
_Keep Dancing Inc_: **"** We instantly felt in love with this song when it came out last year and we just can't get over it. The best song to wake up to after a late night out and get ready for a lazy Sunday. **"**

## Donna Lewis – I Love You Always Forever
_Keep Dancing Inc_: **"** Our favourite car song makes a perfect morning situation. Gorgeous in every way. **"**

## [Cleaners From Venus](https://thecleanersfromvenus.bandcamp.com/) – Corridor of Dreams
_Keep Dancing Inc_: **"** After playing at Soup Kitchen in Manchester on a Saturday night, we woke up the next day with this track at a friend's place and it just felt so right. Sunday mornings forever. **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Keep Dancing Inc – Back Against Yours
_Charlotte_: **"** I discovered [Keep Dancing Inc](https://www.facebook.com/keepdancinginc/) with “Back Against Yours”, that a friend sent me a few years ago. It is the kind of song that could turn a day full of missed buses, dog shits under the left shoe, computer viruses and lost keys into a good one. **"**

## [Black Marble](https://blackmarble.bandcamp.com/) – A Great Design
_Charlotte_: **"** When I met Charles and Louis, two of the members of Keep Dancing Inc a few years ago, it was the first band that we shared a common enthusiasm for. “A Great Design” is like a plane take-off, and is also one of the songs that I often listen to during flights to calm me down and to not end up in an online video untitled “YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT GIRL HAVING A MASSIVE PANIC ATTACK IN A PLANE SOOOO HILARIOUS”. **"**

## [Patience](https://patienceisavirtue.bandcamp.com/) – White of an Eye
_Charlotte_: **"** Patience is Roxanne Clifford, ex-guitarist and singer of Veronica Falls, a Scottish band who split in 2014. I probably shouldn’t say this, but in a way, I’m kind of happy that they did. If not, Roxanne Clifford would never have worked that much on her side project, which I definitely prefer to her previous band. I’ve chosen “White of An Eye”, but all the songs from the EP deserve the same religious attention. **"**

## Idiot Glee – Pinkwood
_Charlotte_: **"** Well known to be the “Horse Capital of the World” and its bourbon production (so says Wikipedia), you wouldn’t considerate at first Lexington, a city in the State of Kentucky as a particularly vibrant musical epicentre. However, among ponies drinking expensive alcohol, you’ll be able to cross path with a lot of local talented musicians such as [Idiot Glee](https://idiotglee.bandcamp.com/), aka James Friley. And with “Pinkwood”, I have no difficulty to picture myself attending one of his concerts in a back garden on a calm evening during late summer in Lexington. Cliché but true. **"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Keep Dancing Inc](https://www.facebook.com/keepdancinginc/) for being our guest this week, and to [Camille Celestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode’s illustration!</p>
