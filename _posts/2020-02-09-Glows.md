<p id="introduction">This morning, we’re wandering deep in a twilit mirror maze with [Glows](https://slowdancerecords.bandcamp.com/album/j-l-hooker-love-pleasure-forever), navigating the boundaries of our myriad selves. Follow the second star to the right and carry straight on till sunrise, riding invisible currents of lost shadows through this otherworldly playground.
<br><br>
Dislocated in space and time, take this time to rewild your soul. Arm yourself with imagination and emerge from the viscose sheen of your human cocoon to float across the dark grounds of palace gardens and empty ballrooms, desert islands and apartment courtyards. Time, tide and gravity are waiting for no-one, and you are only as spectral as your mind allows.

# Glows' selection

##  [Annabel (lee)](https://annabel-lee.bandcamp.com/album/if-music-presents-by-the-sea-and-other-solitary-places) - Believe
_Glows_: **"**I found this through a long hauntology passageway. This stuff is absolutely unreal, from another world. The use of sampled strings from classical and soundtrack music, paired with Annabel's mystical vocals is just stunning, like Portishead, Broadcast there's an untouchable alure to the sounds.**"**

##  [Bunny Hoova](https://themthere.bandcamp.com/album/longing) - Eat Out
_Glows_: **"**My pals Squid tweeted this one at me, and now im obsessed. Maybe my favourite album from last year, an underrated classic. Most of the stuff on their label Them There is amazing, feeding the current of lofi messed up experimental music from London. Lucky enough to be putting on Bunny Hoova at my new venue SLOW SPACE on the 1st March.**"**

##  [Normil Hawaiians](https://bandcamp.normilhawaiians.com/album/more-wealth-than-money) - Other Ways Of Knowing
_Glows_: **"**Amazing post-punk from the 80's, I went on this just because of the name. I'm pretty obsessed with Tropical aesthetics, writing my dissertation on tropical hauntology, this band seem to use a lot of warped tropical themes, sections of spoken word and sound pieces.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Glows](https://soundcloud.com/glowsmusic) - Evaporated Girl
_ImaCrea_: **"**There's a kind of nostalgic feeling here, like a blurry reminiscence. Spinning, spinning, spinning vibrations, reverberating waves echoed in the sphere of lucid dreams. Debut album ['J.L HOOKER LOVE PLEASURE FOREVER'](https://slowdancerecords.bandcamp.com/album/j-l-hooker-love-pleasure-forever) out now, released by the great people at [Slow Dance](http://slowdance.co.uk/).**"**

## Leon Vynehall - From The Sea/It Looms (Chapters I & II)
_ImaCrea_: **"**Elegance and refinement. This track introduce his debut album, ['Nothing is Still'](https://leonvynehall.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-is-still), which I highly recommend. A beautiful work of art and deep love. If you have great speakers or headphones, it's time to push that volume up.**"**

## [Galen Tipton](https://orangemilkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/fake-meat) - Gummy (feat Seth Graham)
_ImaCrea_: **"**Do you know trees are living beings? Maybe these sounds are inspired by their languages with mushrooms and insects...**"**

## [Jeff Parker](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/suite-for-max-brown) - 3 For L
_ImaCrea_: **"**Let's keep it relaxed and chill. Jeff's back to delight us with his unique delicate groove.**"**
