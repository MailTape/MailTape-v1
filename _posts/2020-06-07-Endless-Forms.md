<p id="introduction">We are so excited to welcome [Endless Forms](https://soundcloud.com/endlessforms) to select a Sunday morning playlist with us. 
<br><br>
Endless Forms creates ebbs and flows of intensity through his instrumentals, all as a backdrop to his intricate and powerful lyricism. I recommend listening to his entire album as it plays as an epic of self examination and discovery, with each song effortlessly feeding into the next.

# Endless Form's selection

## Moses Sumney – Doomed
Endless Forms: **"**I’ve been listening to this song a lot this past week. It’s a very compelling, grounding song that lets me into what I’m feeling in a delicate, big-exhale kind of way. This past week has been really emotional with all of the protests and police brutality in the United States, and sometimes it’s challenging to process my feelings when the situation is so incredibly unresolved, and when I'm tangled up in critical analysis. This song gives me a sort of permission to feel, even when I don't fully understand what I'm feeling, which can be incredibly healing, and useful for staying engaged.**"**

## Arcade Fire – Haiti
Endless Forms: **"This song is kinda where it all began for me, musically speaking. I have a distinct memory of sitting alone in my older sister’s car after school in 8th grade, waiting for her to get done with softball practice and drive me home. The breakdown in the song came, where there is this repetitive, siren-like steel-drum sound, and it sent me into this trance-like state. The chord progression is constantly revolving back in on itself, and it’s actually a very meditative song. The lyrics are about Régine Chassagne’s relationship to Haiti, which her parents fled in the 1960s when it was ruled by the violent, totalitarian president Francois Duvalier. This song is simultaneously this tribute to Haiti as her home country, and it also carries all of this deep grief for the ways Duvalier killed Haiti’s citizens and forced Régine’s family into exile. That duality makes a lot of sense to me as an American — the feeling of being completely culturally and politically dissonant with your own homeland."**

## Sigur Rós – Untitled # 2 - Fyrsta
Endless Forms: **"**When I was a teenager I used to stay up all night painting while listening to Sigur Rós. I was such an emotional teen, with so much heavy passion, and Sigur Rós helped me find a way to channel it into art. That process is so important to me right now — learning how to shape that heavy passion into a meaningful, realized form. I've always found this song so compellingly and uncompromisingly pure, and it’s still a sort of true north for me.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Endless Forms – Feel The Pain
Sanjay: **"**Delving into the archives, ‘Return To Jeka’ brings together eight previously unreleased works recorded between 1983 and 1985. Michal's tunes have a hazy fidelity, flitting nimbly between electronics and layers of hand drums.**"**

## Hilsa – Wash
Sanjay: **"**The electroacoustic duo of guitarist Kallie Lampel and cellist Steve Goodwin (aka Skeleton Zoo) combine hypnotic guitar loops, electroacoustic sounds and shimmering electronics to create a somewhat hazy, rusty and cinematic sound. Transportive.**"**

## Tomeka Reid and Alexander Hawkins – Albert Ayler (His Life Was Too Short)
Sanjay: **"**A peaceful and almost pastoral homage to Albert Ayler, originally composed by a master from the first generation of the AACM, Leroy Jenkins.**"**

## Anarchist Mountains – Lift
Sanjay: **"**Anarchist Mountains is a duet project between Jordan Christoff & Stefan Christoff. Devoid of computer sounds, screens or presets, their meditative and ambient palette of sounds uses only synthesizers, organ, various hardware effects and field recordings.**"**
