<p id="introduction">This sunday morning, with our guest [Poldoore](https://www.facebook.com/Poldoore), we propose you a _"Warm-up's Tape"_ for the spring's coming. But don't worry, you don't have to get out of the bed. Just press play and allow yourself to be soothed by the sunny vibes that shine from this selection .</p>

# It's all about good vibes

**Poldoore**, aka Thomas Schillebeeckx, is a talented belgian beatmaker. His atmospheric instrumental hip-hop profoundly influenced by jazz, funk and soul is a perfect example that what we want to listen a sunday morning. Poldoore's music is about good vibes. Spending parts of his youth in the US, Poldoore quickly found himself making beats. With his ears both in old and new, he carved out his own distinctive, melodic sound.


# Poldoore's morning inspiration

## Singularis – Morning Tears
_Poldoore:_ **"**This jazzy joint, coming from the talented 18 year-old producer Singularis, came out on Cold Busted about two years ago. I can’t even remember how many times I put this on, first thing in the morning... The atmosphere on it just begs to be featured in your Sunday morning playlist, or any morning playlist for that matter.**"**

## Air – La Femme D’Argent
_Poldoore:_ **"** When I was 16, I bought Air’s debut album Moon Safari randomly for a couple of euros at a local record store after my uncle told me he was a big fan of them. It immediately became my favorite one in my CD collection. I listened to it over and over again... The Rhodes in the opening track La Femme D’Argent are simply mesmerizing, especially in combination with the sound of rain they subtlely layered over the intro. Perfect to wake up to.**"**

## DJ Cam Quartet – Rebirth Of Cool
_Poldoore:_ **"**I can’t remember how I came across this tune, but I do know it always manages to make me instantly happy. The melody, the boom bap drum beat, the solos… they all add up to the lush vibe that this song is all about. I’d love to work with skilled jazz musicians myself one day.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! A big thank to our guest [Poldoore](https://soundcloud.com/poldoore) and his great morning selection.
Enjoy your sunday.
