<p id="introduction">
Our pick of the week is Daniel McBride, an artist from Wellington who goes by the name [Sheep, Dog & Wolf](http://sheepdogandwolf.com/) and with whom we unveil an episode that will tug at your heartstrings.</p>

# A kaleidoscope of colors
It wouldn’t be hard to imagine oneself in a commune while singing in unison to Sheep, Dog & Wolf’s Egospect; a track which shares the same name as that of his debut album.  The track is raw and natural as it calls out to your primal instinct.

Bath’s Ironworks is an outpouring of harmony that drizzles like an early morning rain giving way to a clear sky and fresh morning – speaking of morning, Arms and Sleeper’s Swim Team is yet another track, all fashioned to engage you with a rapturous morning.  

While you contemplate that life without music is just so incomplete we at Mailtape bring you something of the like that triggers that very thought of yours.   With that said, we end our episode with Strong Love by Gap Dream and hope you to have an exciting week ahead. 


# Sheep, Dog and Wolf's morning inspiration

## Baths - Ironworks
_SDW:_ **"**I can't even describe how much I love Baths. I discovered him with his debut, Cerulean, which came out quite a while ago now. It's full of gorgeous, joyous tracks, and it was like nothing I'd ever heard before! His follow-up, Obsidian, which this track is from, was quite a change in direction; much darker, more introspective. Most of the album is very, very intense, at times deeply depressive and at others raw and abrasive - this track is one of the more relaxed ones however, and I just bliss out every time I hear it.**"**
 
## Ghoul - Swimming Pool (Seekae remix)
_SDW:_ **"**This Ghoul is not the Ghoul you may be thinking of! Many times I've searched for a track by this Ghoul and come up with something from the death metal band of the same name. This Ghoul is not death metal at all; they were a Sydney band (sadly now disbanded) that made weird and wonderful music that is near impossible to describe. Give their mini-LP Dunks a listen, it is amazing! The vocal style is completely unique, and absolutely captivating.
This particular track is a remix by Seekae, and it's brilliant.**"**
 
## Lontalius - yr heart is beating
_SDW:_ **"**Lontalius, a.k.a. Eddie Johnston, is a 17-year-old musical prodigy from Wellington, New Zealand. Being Wellington-based myself, I am lucky enough to be able to work with him, and he is a truly inspirational guy! This track is just so perfect, short and sweet, heartbreaking, and absolutely beautiful. After you listen to this, go and listen to everything else he has ever released, it is all amazing.**"**
