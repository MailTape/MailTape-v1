# Holy Tongue's selection

## [Astrid Øster Mortensen](https://astridostermortensen.bandcamp.com/album/gro-mig-en-blomst) - Solen Er Et Lille Hus

**Valentina**: **"**I have been listening to this artist quite a lot lately. This album is a beautiful ride. I initially was drawn to it by the artwork on the cover. Hard to single out a track on this, to me it works as a whole as most releases out on the Swedish scene like Forlag For Fri Musik.**"**

## [Silvana Simone](https://ultimotango.bandcamp.com/album/ritmiche-italiane) - Dimensione Ritmo

**Valentina, Allen and Susumu**: **"**We all loved this compilation. We have been playing “Dimensione Ritmo” and “Jungla” during radio programs and dj sets.**"**

## [Vasilisk](https://steinklangindustries.bandcamp.com/album/sk78-vasilisk-mkwaju-2014) - Photongnoul

**Allen**: **"**This record came out in 1988, recorded by a Japanese trio in Tokyo. It’s highly ritualised, transcendental, repetitive percussion with industrial ambience. It’s quite intense but not in an aggressive way, more ecstatic. The artwork and titles are very compelling as well, it really creates a complete atmosphere.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Holy Tongue](https://amidahrecords.bandcamp.com/album/deliveTongue) - Joachim

**ImaCrea**: **"**This track comes from their latest album, [Deliverance And Spiritual Warfare](https://amidahrecords.bandcamp.com/album/delivWarfare). I find it very hypnotic. I love how each of their albums is a new page and explores different musical landscapes in a unique way. This one is particularly introspective, able to trigger moments of revelation and vivid visualization. Their generosity and passion can be clearly heard, and I highly recommend seeing them live if you have the opportunity.**"**

## [Masanori Oishi](http://www.m-oishi.com) - Tatatata Duo

**ImaCrea**: **"**It's been a while since I was waiting for the right moment to delve into this album. Having Holy Tongue as our guest and listening to their selection, I felt the moment was perfect for it. What a ride, very intense. This track comes from his album [No Man's 
Land](https://tower.jp/item/3879763/NO-MAN'S-LAND-MasanLand), where he plays JacobTV's tracks. I picked this one for its progressive build-up and cathartic explosion.**"**

## Charmaine Lee - False Gravity

**ImaCrea**: **"**I discovered Charmaine Lee's music as I was exploring latest releases by french label [Erratum Musical](https://erratum.bandcamp.com/). Her amazing experimental composition, and true mastery of the ability of human voice.**"**

## Chafouin - En mode Glass

**ImaCrea**: **"**I listened a lot to their album [In C](https://chafouin.bandcamp.com/album/in-c-3) where they play Terry Riley recently. And in the context of curating this episode, I discovered their latest album, [Trois, quatre](https://chafouin.bandcamp.com/album/trois-quatre). This track melting together vibes from contemporary music and progressive rock is a masterpiece.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for being with us. **If you plan to be in Paris on march the 29th, book your evening... More info very very soon, watch your emails!** A thousand thanks for Valentina, Allen and Susumu from Holy Tongue. Lots of gratitude to [Patricia](https://www.instagram.com/olharesfuturos/) for her catchy illustration. Until next Sunday, stay tuned.</p>
