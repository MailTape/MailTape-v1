# Holy Tongues's selection

## [Astrid Øster Mortensen](https://astridostermortensen.bandcamp.com/album/gro-mig-en-blomst) - Solen Er Et Lille Hus

**Valentina**: **"**I have been listening to this artist quite a lot lately. This album is a beautiful ride. I initially was drawn to it by the artwork on the cover. Hard to single out a track on this, to me it works as a whole as most releases out on the Swedish scene like Forlag For Fri Musik.**"**

## [Silvana Simone](https://ultimotango.bandcamp.com/album/ritmiche-italiane) - Dimensione Ritmo

**Valentina, Allen and Susumu**: **"**We all loved this compilation. We have been playing “Dimensione Ritmo” and “Jungla” during radio programs and dj sets.**"**

## [Vasilisk](https://steinklangindustries.bandcamp.com/album/sk78-vasilisk-mkwaju-2014) - Photongnoul

**Allen**: **"**This record came out in 1988, recorded by a Japanese trio in Tokyo. It’s highly ritualised, transcendental, repetitive percussion with industrial ambience. It’s quite intense but not in an aggressive way, more ecstatic. The artwork and titles are very compelling as well, it really creates a complete atmosphere.**"**
