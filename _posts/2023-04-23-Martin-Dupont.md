# Martin Dupont's selection

## Dalis Car - Moonlife

Martin Dupont: **"**Dalis Car is a band formed by Peter Murphy from the band 'Bauhaus', and Mick Karn from the band 'Japan'. I believe it makes sense to have Martin Dupont start its selection with this track. Firstly, there's the way the bass is played, fretless, which gives it a particular tonality and color that I also like to play for Martin Dupont. Secondly, we can hear some clarinet, which you can also find in our tracks. The track featured here is 'Moonlife'. I am seduced by how the bass is played, and it's a way that inspires me greatly in my own playing. This album is a project from two giants who had a big impact on me back in the day. I sense vibes from oriental 18th-century chamber music, but in a pop style. Peter Murphy's singing is less guttural than in Bauhaus, and here it's heartfelt, rather than in the batcave style.**"**


## Indoor Life - Archeology

Martin Dupont: **"**This is a hidden gem by a collective from San Francisco. It's a band I saw in the early/mid-80s at a small concert in the university where I was studying. There was something I had never seen before: this guy with a saxophone managed to produce crazy effects with his instrument. Cables were coming out of the instrument, his attitude was sly, creating a kind of voodoo atmosphere. The singer's way of expressing himself also touched me deeply. It came from the heart, modulating with suffering and deep tension.**"**

## Wall of Voodoo - Ring of Fire

Martin Dupont: **"**It is their first EP that I find the most original. I had been hesitating between two tracks for a while. One of them has a very American style that I am not too familiar with, as it is a cover of Johnny Cash. However, I find it very interesting. Speaking of Johnny Cash, even though his style is not exactly my cup of tea, I have a lot of respect for his work, especially his cover of 'Hurt' by 'Nine Inch Nails'. After careful consideration, 'Ring of Fire' is my first choice. I love the singer's voice, which reminds me of an American chewing gum while speaking. The addition of real drums to the rhythm box creates a rich atmosphere. Moreover, the guitar sound is extremely well-crafted, pure and raw.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Martin Dupont - Inside Out

ImaCrea: **"**From the very first second, the energy of this sound gripped me and didn't let go for weeks. I only discovered Martin Dupont recently and, without having experienced the original era of these intoxicating rhythms, I still feel a sweet and joyful sense of nostalgia. It was a time when music was magically crafted with electronic instruments to convey the full emotional power of human life at its strongest. An ode to youth, love, and life.**"**

## Gary Allen - Oops It's an Accident

ImaCrea: **"**As I listened for days to compilations of new wave and albums picked up along with the groove of the moment, suddenly comes this completely crazy sound. Taken directly and instinctively in my gut, this track by Gary Allen is a kind of magical encounter between queer madness and the grandiloquence of minimal synths. Grace Jones in a convertible speeding through a neon tunnel.**"**

## El - Og Tilslutt

ImaCrea: **"**After listening to so much new wave, I fell into a romantic trip. Of course. And for me, this sound encapsulates all the poetic romance so unique to the genre. You can feel the inspiration of The Cure in the bass, obviously, but here with an even darker atmosphere. Dracula transformed into a wolf howls in the heart of the forest. Where has the imagination gone?**"**


## Art Fact - Rain in the South

ImaCrea: **"**End of the 80s in Sweden, a cold, industrial, polluted world stands as an insurmountable horizon. The machine has taken over, money is king. Smoke pours out of factories. Contemporary sadness, where has the future gone? Have we woken up from this nightmare or have we convinced ourselves that it was only a dream in our torpor maintained by screens that absorb all our attention? It is good to cry, to experience this sadness. To better transmute it, to live all our emotions, to accept them and then overcome them. And finally find our desire again.**"**

<p id="outroduction">Thatâ€™s it for this Sunday morning! Thanks for being with us.
