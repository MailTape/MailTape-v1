<p id="outroduction">Thatâ€™s it for this Sunday morning! Thanks for being with us. Put the volume up, and dance with your neighbors. Much love to [Alexi Shell](https://alexishell.bandcamp.com/album/sirens) for her ecstatic selection which gave me great joy to make my selection. Also, big "bravo" to Meriam for this stunning illustration and her work which keeps surprising me amazingly. So much beauty here.</p>
