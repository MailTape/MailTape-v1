<p id="introduction">This morning, the climate is one of grumbling and discontent. Voices are being raised in the streets to try to make things happen, to have adecent life and above al to respected as suchand according to our professions. Fortunately, we have the [Fun Fun Funeral](https://funfunfuneral.bandcamp.com/) selection to soo the tensions and put some balm to the heart. 
<br><br>
[Fun Fun Funeral](https://www.facebook.com/funfunfuneral/) is madness and joy. It's a multitude of mixed emotions and an incredible palette of colours. Their firts album "[Everything Is Ok](https://soundcloud.com/octobertone/sets/fun-fun-funeral-everything-is)" released on Ocotber 25th is a concentred of good mood and these days it feels good ! 
</p>

# Fun Fun Funeral's selection

## Helvetia – Kris
_Fun Fun Funeral_: **"**We recently discovered this song through our friend, Allan, who was driving us on tour in the UK. The whole album is great and the sound of the recording is really special.This one was often on repeat; the way it evolves from a fairly dark, melancholic song into a harmonious frenzy kept us going back to it.**"**

## Tirzah – No Romance
_Fun Fun Funeral_: **"**The voice of [Tirzah](https://www.facebook.com/TirzahMusic/) along with Mica Levi's production go so well together. This is such a hypnotic little ditty, with 'no romance' being repeated over and over, and a really fun beat to go with it.**"**

## Rocky Lorelei – Lily
_Fun Fun Funeral_: **"**[Rocky](https://rockylorelei.bandcamp.com/) is a very special artist who creates wonderful lo-fi recordings of songs that are filled with imagination and sincerity.I like how she used rhythmic breathing in this song as a kind of drum beat, it feels really organic. The positivity in these lyrics make it a perfect song to start the day with.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Fun Fun Funeral](https://funfunfuneral.bandcamp.com/) – Elba Sea
_Anaïs G_: **"**It is unlike any other, it is tinged with a joyfulpop, it all ows you to escape your mind for a few moments and enter the magical world of this franco-english duo. It's an eccentric brass band that allows us to escape and take the life on the right side!**"**

## Eera – Christine
_Anaïs G_: **"**Through her music, [Eera](https://www.facebook.com/eeramusic/) teaches us to face our fears and to face them. It is with her sweet voice that the Norwegian Anna Lena Bruland aka Eera, reveals her weaknesses and counts her doubts to us, to better advance and face life but also to recover the lost confidence.**"**

## Promise Keepers – Backfired
_Anaïs G_:**"**Discovered in 2017 with [the label Atelier Ciseaux](http://www.atelierciseaux.com/category/news/), it is one of the songs that do not ageand above all that i can listen to over and over again without moderation. William Fussel aka [Promise Keeper](https://atelierciseaux.bandcamp.com/album/promise-keeper-s-t), manages to immerse us in an extreme trance and a feeling of ultimate weel-being comparable to he enjoyment of the body. It's beautiful it's hot.. I don't have the words !**"**

## Samana – Harvest
_Anaïs G_: **"**Soft, sumptuous and hypnotic, these are the adjectives that come to mind when i listen to [Samana](https://www.samanaroad.com/samana-home). This feminine/male duo formed by Rebecca Rose Harris and Franklin Mockett plays with colors, black and white, and note of music architecture throught their first album "[Ascension](https://samana.bandcamp.com/album/ascension)", released last May. Perfect for sunday morning full of hope.**"**
