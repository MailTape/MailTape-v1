# Fun Fun Funeral's selection

## Helvetia – Kris
_Fun Fun Funeral_: **"**We recently discovered this song through our friend, Allan, who was driving us on tour in the UK. The whole album is great and the sound of the recording is really special.This one was often on repeat; the way it evolves from a fairly dark, melancholic song into a harmonious frenzy kept us going back to it.**"**
