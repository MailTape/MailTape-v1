<p id="introduction">This morning, like a divine light coming from nowhere, caressing our bodies, music moves us, borders us with our fingertips and astonishes us. Differentiated by its infinity, by these genres and multiple styles, it transports the spirits to take them into parallel worlds, this is what [Tomemitsu](https://tomemitsu.bandcamp.com/) shares with us this Sunday morning through a high selection in musical color. 
<br><br>
Beautiful and enchanting are the melodies of [Tomemitsu](https://www.facebook.com/tomemitsu), originally from LA, the city where everything is possible. His music that can be defined as pop bedroom is much more than that... It is a dream awakened towards the hope and inner fire that animates us, comforting us in the idea of staying under the quilt to take good time .

# Tomemitsu's selection

## Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers - Christ is all
_Tomemitsu_: **"**Growing up I went to church just about every Sunday and what I ended up taking from that was exposure to and an appreciation for different types of music. There’s such a beauty to many voices singing together, especially ones like Sam Cooke’s. I love the organ work as well as the way the background vocals give this song dynamics and a rolling energy.**"**

## Harold Grosskopf - Synthesist
_Tomemitsu_: **"**RVNG did a nice reissue of [Harold Grosskopf](http://www.haraldgrosskopf.de/)'s album, Synthesist. This is one of my favorite tracks to play while making coffee. The Kraut beats get my motor running, and these synthesizers are heavenly. This one is really good for driving in the morning too.**"**

## Joao Gilberto - Chega de Saudade
_Tomemitsu_: **"**I had a tough time choosing my favorite Joao Gilberto song because so many are incredible. When a bunch of early JB albums were reissued on vinyl I picked up as many as I could. I have learned so much about beauty and sadness listening to him sing and trying to decipher all the lovely chords and changes. There really is such depth of emotion, but at the same time he seems to sing with a care free attitude.**"** 


# MailTape's selection

## Tomemitsu - I Shatter 
_Anaïs G_: **"**His songs are part of my Sunday morning special chill playist. Sweet, sensual with a hint of melancholy, whether they speak of heart to take or separation, [Tomemitsu](https://soundcloud.com/tomemitsu) is only love so let’s take another dose!**"**

## [Curtis Harding](https://soundcloud.com/curtishardingofficial) - Welcome to my world
_Anaïs G_: **"**It is by varying the pleasures and especially the musical genres that one manages to have a better knowledge and a beautiful opening on music. "Slop 'n soul", drawing on the R'N'B as much as blues or gospel. An exceptional mixture for a moment of letting go, sexyness and tenderness. **"**

## [Kokoroko](https://www.facebook.com/kokorokomusic/) - Abusey Junction
_Anaïs G_: **"**The first time I heard this song, it was like a lightning strike, a feeling of absolute fullness. As an evidential, it takes us through its jazzy and afrobeat rhythms with such a natural and such simplicity that it makes it an exceptional title.**"**

## [Xenoula](https://www.facebook.com/xenoulaofficial/) - Caramello
_Anaïs G_: **"**Spicy and tangy at the same time, easy to dive into the world of Xenoula and change skin to adapt to the variants of its music.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thank you so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Tomemitsu](https://www.facebook.com/tomemitsu/) for her Sunday selection, and to [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/?hl=fr) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
