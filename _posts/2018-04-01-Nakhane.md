<p id="introduction">This morning, we bring you the irresistible and striking [Nakhane](https://www.facebook.com/nakhaneofficial) for a MailTape full of felicity.</p>

South Africa is a nest filled with musical gems and talents often hard to discover. A country pulsating with mixed styles, uncut expressions and authentic souls. Nakhane is an honest and delicate incarnation creating music coated with fragile emotions and touching messages.

His silky and hypnotizing voice paired with his luscious dancing and raw moves will instantly charm and pacify you. “You will not die”, his second album, is a powerhouse of shared stories and personal thoughts. A mirror to his soul, his style is sensible yet truly poignant.

An original talent, Nakhane is a world class guide of authentic and organic music.


# Nakhane's selection


## Joan As Policewoman - Damned Devotion
_Nakhane_: **"**Joan Wasser never strains. The melodies are all syrupy and easy. It’s as if she doesn’t try at all. And they’re hypnotizing. But dig a little deeper into the words, and you’ll find some erotic metaphors hidden in there. The percussion is stunning. That chorus!**"**

## Janelle Monae - Django Jane
_Nakhane_: **"**This is the Janelle I didn’t know I needed until I heard this track. Bars bars bars! Politics (of all kinds) never sounded more entertainment. And the braggadocio! She’s unhinged and I’ve never been more excited. Then there’s that line: “Hit the mute button/Let the vagina have a monologue”. **"**

## Nils Frahm - Sunson
_Nakhane_: **"**The organ in the begin reminds me of Jeff Buckley’s “Lover, You Should Have Come Over”. But then Nils switches it up on us, and moves the pretty ambiance into beautifully repetitive techno rhythm. Fucks with my mind and with my body**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Nakhane - The Dead
_ImaCrea_: **"**Nakhane releases here a multi-layered track with a profound and spiritual inspiration. The more I listen to it, the more I get carried away. A delicate string stretched between earth and sky waiting to be strummed.**"**

## Chris Thile - Thanks for Listening
_ImaCrea_: **"**Now in the sky, let's travel among clouds on a flying book of poetry. I discovered this track randomly in the chilled atmosphere of a warm café in Copenhagen I believe.**"**

## Moderator - Burning Bridges
_ImaCrea_: **"**Revisiting here 'real' triphop here with this fresh release included in his upcoming album, ["Sinners Syndrome"](https://moderator.bandcamp.com/album/sinners-syndrome-2). Something tells me it's going to be a beautiful trip.**"**

## Yuma Guma - Cosmic Baby
_ImaCrea_: **"**Fresh and French new pop sensation, spring is here baby! Discover their [first EP](https://soundcloud.com/yumaguma/sets/ep-1) and prepare for summer...**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love to Louise for inviting the grand [Nakhane](https://www.facebook.com/nakhaneofficial/), and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this perfect illustration.</p>
