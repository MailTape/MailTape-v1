<p id="introduction">
This morning, two special guests invite you to their universe. Please enter the world of the duo [Grandbrothers](https://soundcloud.com/grandbrothers "Grandbrothers Soundcloud").</p>

# Experimentations

Unusual, that's what you could think at first while listening to them. Their [Ezra EP](http://grandbrothers.de/ "Grandbrothers Bandcamp") and the tunes they [share](https://soundcloud.com/grandbrothers "Grandbrothers Soundcloud") on soundcloud convey many different feelings at a time: bewitched and ecstatic. This is the result of their musical experiment, trying to push further the limits of their grand piano. We're maybe not used enough to come across such approach and that's exactly the reason why we decided to introduce you to them.

#Their morning selection

## Nils Frahm - Re
_Grandbrothers:_ **"**Nils' music has always been a big inspiration to us - his way of combining sadness with beauty is simply brilliant. Imagine this song on a rainy sunday, you're slightly hung over, you don't want to see anyone... you'll feel happier - or sadder - probably both...**"**

## Jono McCleery - Ballade
_Grandbrothers:_ **"**After you've woken up hardly, this song has the perfect flow to get through the day. And that voice...**"**

## Grey Reverend - Nightingale
_Grandbrothers:_ **"**This one should be on everyone's alarm clock. After the first ten seconds of that catchy intro you should instantly get up, make yourself a cup of coffee and enjoy your day.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to [Grandbrothers](https://www.facebook.com/grandbrothers "Grandbrothers Facebook") for their selection and to Mirka Pflüger for the photo. Thanks for listening, enjoy your sunday !
