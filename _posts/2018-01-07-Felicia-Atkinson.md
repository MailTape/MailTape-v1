<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome preeminent Rennes-based avant-garde composer [Félicia Atkinson](http://feliciaatkinson.com/) to collaborate with us on MailTape. She weaves myriad, filigree electro-acoustic and non-musical metanarratives into a sonic lucid dream.</p>
<p>Félicia Atkinson is a musician with many more strings to her bow. On her latest album 'Hand in Hand', however, the atmosphere of reflective anticipation is the main sonic theme—where a sense of the otherworldly is paired with the familiar and the macabre with the sensual.</p>


# Félicia Atkinson's selection


## Tomoko Sauvage – Musique Hydromantique
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Wake up early enough to see the sun rise and breathe its energy.**"**

## Luc Ferrari – Presque rien n°1, le lever du jour au bord de la mer
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Let the silence become music and contemplate the light changing.**"**

## Cinema – Sem Toto
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Jump and raise your arms to the sun. It’s gonna be a good day enough.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Félicia Atkinson – I'm Following You
_Sanjay_: **"**[Félicia Atkinson](http://feliciaatkinson.com/)'s latest album 'Hand in Hand' fuses field recordings, modular and MIDI electronics with an almost hypnotising line in whispered vocal narration. A warbling ambient-pop introduction is the opening track to the reflective anticipation of the album.**"**

## Mondkopf – The Call
_Sanjay_: **"**The musical moniker of Paul Régimbeau, [Mondkopf](http://mondkopf.tumblr.com/)'s electronic music often feels extremely literal. This track is taken from the [Musique Ambiante Française Vol. 1](https://tigersushirecords.bandcamp.com/album/musique-ambiante-fran-aise-vol-1) compilation on Tigersushi. It's a serene and seductive suite of ambient or beatless works using old and new analog machines.**"**

## Christine Ott – Tropismes
_Sanjay_: **"**A studied enactment of both vision and virtuosity, Tropismes is taken from [Christine Ott](http://www.christineott.fr/)'s solo album, 'Only Silence Remains'. Shadowy and minimal, the melody is subtly sketched and the arrangement given ample space and light.**"**

## Murcof & Vanessa Wagner – Variations For The Healing Of Arinushka
_Sanjay_: **"**A beautiful collaboration in which Fernando Corona (Murcof) and Vanessa Wagner sensitively condense and escalate elements of Arvo Pärt’s 'Variations for the Healing of Arinushka' from lonely piano and spectral electronics to a grandiose swell of strings, keys and marching drums, before returning to quietude.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it! Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Félicia Atkinson](http://feliciaatkinson.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's sweet illustration!</p>
