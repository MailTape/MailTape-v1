# A graphic music

Formed by the merger of french musicians and graphic artists, Bloum is more than just a band. This is a project articulated around an idea: build a concert where the music also lives with eyes.

# Bloum's morning inspiration
 
## X_1 - Just You
_Bloum:_ **"**Shiny and minimal track dropped by the excellent producer X_1 from our Parisan friend’s label Beat X Changers. Just you is a condensate of love which make us shake through the night.**"**
 
## Our Mother - Lion OS X
_Bloum:_ **"**Powerfull track build on blow minded voices and a very strong bassdrop which always gave us goosebump. This is what we call our ‘detox song’.**"**
 
## Sufjan Stevens - Futile Devices (Shigeto Remix)
_Bloum:_ **"**Futile devices was one of the countless gem provided by Sufjan Stevens, the genius from Michigan. Shigeto made a poetic remix of it adding catchy drums and melancholic reverbed voices. Perfect for a chill sunday morning!**"**
