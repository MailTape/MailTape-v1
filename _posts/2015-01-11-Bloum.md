<p id="introduction">This morning, we offer you a journey to the end of the night, in a world filled with reveries, with one of the most exciting bands from the Parisian indie scene, [Bloum](https://www.facebook.com/Projetbloum)</p>

# A graphic music

Formed as a result of collaboration between French musicians and graphic artists, **Bloum** is more than just a band. It is more of a project that centers around the idea that music should also be visually pleasing. The result was an escape from the senses where their minimalist and hypnotic music—carried out by the graphics of their live performances— invite us to introspection.

# Bloum's morning inspiration
 
## X_1 - Just You
_Bloum:_ **"**Shiny and minimal track dropped by the excellent producer X_1 from our Parisan friend’s label Beat X Changers. Just you is a condensate of love which make us shake through the night.**"**
 
## Our Mother - Lion OS X
_Bloum:_ **"**Powerfull track build on blow minded voices and a very strong bassdrop which always gave us goosebump. This is what we call our ‘detox song’.**"**
 
## Sufjan Stevens - Futile Devices (Shigeto Remix)
_Bloum:_ **"**Futile devices was one of the countless gem provided by Sufjan Stevens, the genius from Michigan. Shigeto made a poetic remix of it adding catchy drums and melancholic reverbed voices. Perfect for a chill sunday morning!**"**
