<p id="introduction">This morning I am super-excited to present the Sunday morning jukebox of Pretoria-based guitarist and generally beautiful human being, [Sibusile Xaba](http://sibusilexaba.com/newsite/), for MailTape.</p>
<p>Mentored by Madala Kunene and Dr. Philip Tabane, Sibusile Xaba mixes fragmented lines with repeated phrases. Played acoustically to bass and drums – provided by percussionists Thabang Tabane and Moahanganai Magagula – Sibusile's music soars with expressive guitar-picking and a vocal style that is part dreamscape and part ancestral invocation.</p>
<p>Seeing Sibusile live was a pretty rewarding experience for me. If you're in London, Glasgow, Hull, Kent, Paris or Berlin in the next couple of months, you should definitely [pay him and his trio a visit](http://sibusilexaba.com/newsite/gigguide/)!</p> 


# Sibusile Xaba's selection


## Nono Nkoane - Nomad
_Sibusile Xaba_: **"**[Nono Nkoane](https://www.facebook.com/nononkoane) is a remarkable artist, human/spiritual being and a cure Afrikan woman, I'm simply in love with her artistry and the way she carries herself and her message of "As One"...We go way back and are still moving forward in the same vision...When I think of her or try to explain her, I find no words that I feel can do justice to her sound, she is beyond...I can only say, she is the most unique vocalist of our time/this era. She has perfectly/effortlessly fused traditional xhosa music and the art form of jazz producing something quite unique, something quite fresh, like a gulps of fresh air, she is amazing. I love her, she's a queen.**"**

## Nduduzo Makhathini - King Fela
_Sibusile Xaba_: **"**[Nkonduzo Makhathini](https://www.facebook.com/nduduzo.makhathini) is the most important figure in South African/African music history. What he is doing now is beyond words, both as a spiritual being and a musician he is simply incredible, there is no one like him. What I love the most is  what he has done here at home (SA), King Nduduzo has managed to close the gap (he's the bridge) between the perception of "jazz" in comparison to other music forms, he has a thing of just seeing what he does as only music, music for healing more than any genre. He has diminished the stigma of music genre more than ever, it's all just sound anyway, its only compiled differently... Also his commitment and determination makes his work ethic something to be greatly admired. I wish him all the best, I support his vision of healing through music and love him dearly.**"**

## Itai Hakim - Ni Songo Xela
_Sibusile Xaba_: **"**[Itai Hakim](https://soundcloud.com/itai-hakim) is the next big thing to come out from the South of Africa, he's simply simple and I love that, this says a lot about his soul. I wish him all the best and have lots of love for this King right here.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Sibusile Xaba — Ukukhanya kwa Dr. Philip Tabane
_Sanjay_: **"**You won't find this on either of Crewdson's albums, but if you're familiar with his work you'll definitely recognise the choppy drums, tight basslines, mellow synths, incidental noises and layers of plinky, metallic, high-frequency content – as if he’s sampled absolutely everything. Far from feeling unsettled, Crewdson straddles the borders of rhythm, melody and noise nicely on this track.**"**

## Dr. Philip Tabane & Malombo - Kea Bereka
_Sanjay_: **"**As well as performing in and leading numerous jazz ensembles, [Cassie Kinoshi](https://www.cassiekinoshi.com) has also written for short films and videogames. Primarily known for her work with jazz septet [NÉRIJA](http://www.nerijamusic.com/), Afrobeat band [KOKOROKO](https://www.facebook.com/kokorokomusic/) and her own large ensemble [SEED](https://www.facebook.com/seedensemble/), this is a great piece for mallet trio and piano inspired by the beloved 8-bit game, Tetris.**"**

## Bokani Dyer — Recess
_Sanjay_: **"**A student of both Ustad Zakir Hussain and Ustad Alla Rakha, I first saw [Suphala](http://www.suphala.com/) perform at Rich Mix in London for Soumik Datta's 'Sonic Boom' series in 2015. And I've been waiting patiently to hear her in London since! On this track Suphala fuses beats, field recordings, piano samples, electronics, and her own tabla bols into a beautifully conflated sonic texture.**"**

## Miryam Solomon — Magnolia
_Sanjay_: **"**'Cobalt' is taken from E.M.M.A.'s most recent EP, [LA Mermaid](https://astralplanerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/la-mermaid). The entire EP shimmers with textural montages of etheral synth sounds and iridescent chiming bells. If you're interested and in a position to learn more about melodies, drum patterns, arrangements and EQing, [keep an eye out](https://twitter.com/oiiiemma) for her Producer Girls workshops in the UK.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today. Thanks for listening and much love and thanks to [Sibusile Xaba](http://sibusilexaba.com/newsite/) for being our guest this morning, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration!</p>
