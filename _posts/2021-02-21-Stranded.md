# Stranded's selection

## Air – Playground Love
Stranded: **"**I can’t quite explain, but I often find myself listening to a lot of French music in the mornings with artists like Jacques Dutronc, Francoise Hardy, Juniore, La Femme, Stereolab, and Serge Gainsbourg. So it only seems natural that my first introduction French music takes the spot, Air. I always love Air in their Burt Bacharach-esque moments. Thomas Mars' subtle vocals are lovely but not precious considering the subject matter. It’s a perfectly composed song that exudes warmth whether it’s the melotron like strings or saxophone that comes in and out. The simple piano notes and drum beat lure you in. It’s timeless, and it fits right in when that first sip of coffee as the morning light comes through the window.**"**

## John Cale – [Big White Cloud](https://demofest.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-night)
Stranded: **"**If there is one thing John Cale gets it’s the sound of things. Whether that’s instruments or words he’s lyrical through and through. Even when he seems at a distance or esoteric there is a richness that always reigns me in. Many songs from this album, Vintage Violence, are grand and evocative. “Big White Cloud” is certainly one of them in the simplicity of his imagery surrounded by lushness. You feel like Cale is the captain of your ship, and he can guide you through the morning’s waves of sweeping strings and propelled by one of my favorite voices of all time.**"**

## OMD – Radio Prague, Genetic Engineering
OMD- “Radio Prague”
Stranded: **"**These two together, in order, are essential. “Radio Prague” is the perfect introduction to Dazzle Ships. It reminds me of the blue Czech train that goes from Berlin to Prague while imagining an early morning arrival into the city. Then seeing myself stepping off the train into the station with the frenetic morning buzz of “Genetic Engineering.” It’s a cynical song, but like all great OMD it can be both cold and catchy at the same time. Like their heroes Kraftwerk, OMD has always sent me away to places like Northern England or in this case Central Europe.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Stranded  – Cherry Fortune
Sarah: **"**Sharing this oud/piano duet with [Sam Shalabi](https://www.musicworks.ca/sam-shalabi-and-evolution-global-aesthetic), which we recorded at La Sala Rossa concert hall in the morning, we worked with some friends to set-up a recording situation and worked on releasing this track on the album [Flying Street](https://spirodon.bandcamp.com/album/--2) on a community level, it is out on vinyl. I remember the conversations with Sam around this piece, the musical scales are rooted in Nubian music and I loved playing the same note in two octaves, along to the driving melody of the oud, two notes striking accents on the piano while the oud plays. Sam is a great person, I feel lucky to have gotten to know Sam and to have collaborated over the years. Our collaborations first were really driven within the context of a series of local concerts we worked on in the city to support Palestinian human rights and the global [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement](https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi). It has taken time but at the grassroots level, within artistic networks and amongst cultural workers, there is growing support for the BDS movement, as rooted in the example of the way that sanctions and boycotts did help the liberation struggle against apartheid in South Africa. On a personal level I have learned so much from Sam, both musically and also personally, just how to sustain a meaningful, honest and chill presence in a difficult world, thank you Sam.**"**

## Murcof – Underwater Lament
Sarah: **"**Girona-based producer and composer Fernando Corona, also known as [Murcof](https://www.murcof.com/), has announced his first release—'The Alias Sessions', a collaboration with Brazilian choreographer [Guilherme Botelho](https://www.alias-cie.com/en/)—on the Leaf label since 2016. More abstract than many of his previous works, I love the diaphanous atmosphere in this track, incorporating exquisite sound design with ghostly samples and non-tonal sounds. [Check out the choreography on the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ti6u3IRnx4).**"**

## Sibusile Xaba – Wampona
Sarah: **"**[Sibusile Xaba's music](https://sibusilexaba.bandcamp.com/album/ngiwu-shwabada) has been on regular rotation since I first came across his work in the wet summer of 2017. Like the great Philip Tabane, Sibusile mixes fragmented lines with repeated phrases over Thabang Tabane's drums. Accompanied by his vocal style that is part-dreamscaping and part ancestral invocation. If you've got even more time on your hands, listen to [Sibusile's MailTape episode from August 2017](https://www.mailta.pe/275/sibusile-xaba/).**"**

## Talvin Singh & Niladri Kumar – Ananta
Sarah: **"**A beautifully lilting piece from [Talvin Singh](https://www.instagram.com/talvinsinghmusic/?hl=en) and [Niladri Kumar](https://www.niladrikumar.com/)'s album, Together, which I now find difficult to believe was released almost a decade ago! Niladri's sprightly sitar melodies emerge from Talvin's exhilarating tabla percussion, before being 
delectably spliced and diced in post-production.**"**
