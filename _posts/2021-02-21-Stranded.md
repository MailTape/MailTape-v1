# Stranded's selection

## Air – Playground Love
Stranded: **"**I can’t quite explain, but I often find myself listening to a lot of French music in the mornings with artists like Jacques Dutronc, Francoise Hardy, Juniore, La Femme, Stereolab, and Serge Gainsbourg. So it only seems natural that my first introduction French music takes the spot, Air. I always love Air in their Burt Bacharach-esque moments. Thomas Mars' subtle vocals are lovely but not precious considering the subject matter. It’s a perfectly composed song that exudes warmth whether it’s the melotron like strings or saxophone that comes in and out. The simple piano notes and drum beat lure you in. It’s timeless, and it fits right in when that first sip of coffee as the morning light comes through the window.**"**

## John Cale – [Big White Cloud](https://demofest.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-night)
Stranded: **"**If there is one thing John Cale gets it’s the sound of things. Whether that’s instruments or words he’s lyrical through and through. Even when he seems at a distance or esoteric there is a richness that always reigns me in. Many songs from this album, Vintage Violence, are grand and evocative. “Big White Cloud” is certainly one of them in the simplicity of his imagery surrounded by lushness. You feel like Cale is the captain of your ship, and he can guide you through the morning’s waves of sweeping strings and propelled by one of my favorite voices of all time.**"**

## OMD – Radio Prague, Genetic Engineering
OMD- “Radio Prague”
Stranded: **"**These two together, in order, are essential. “Radio Prague” is the perfect introduction to Dazzle Ships. It reminds me of the blue Czech train that goes from Berlin to Prague while imagining an early morning arrival into the city. Then seeing myself stepping off the train into the station with the frenetic morning buzz of “Genetic Engineering.” It’s a cynical song, but like all great OMD it can be both cold and catchy at the same time. Like their heroes Kraftwerk, OMD has always sent me away to places like Northern England or in this case Central Europe.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Stranded](https://strandedmsk.bandcamp.com/)  – Cherry Fortune
Sarah: **"**This track comes off of Stranded's new release, Post Meridian. In this track, Stranded describes pushing himself to create a "moody update for 80's vibes" with layers of texture. The effort is rewarded, Cherry Fortune presents an entire atm**"**

## Saint Etienne – Mario's Cafe
Sarah: **"**This track comes off of Saint Etienne's 1993 album, So Tough. Love the flute that peeks through the track halfway through, there's such a harmonious balance that's rather contagious. The morph of sound by the track's end **"**

##  – Wampona
Sarah: **"**[Sibusile Xaba's music](https://sibusilexaba.bandcamp.com/album/ngiwu-shwabada) has been on regular rotation since I first came across his work in the wet summer of 2017. Like the great Philip Tabane, Sibusile mixes fragmented lines with repeated phrases over Thabang Tabane's drums. Accompanied by his vocal style that is part-dreamscaping and part ancestral invocation. If you've got even more time on your hands, listen to [Sibusile's MailTape episode from August 2017](https://www.mailta.pe/275/sibusile-xaba/).**"**

## Talvin Singh & Niladri Kumar – Ananta
Sarah: **"**A beautifully lilting piece from [Talvin Singh](https://www.instagram.com/talvinsinghmusic/?hl=en) and [Niladri Kumar](https://www.niladrikumar.com/)'s album, Together, which I now find difficult to believe was released almost a decade ago! Niladri's sprightly sitar melodies emerge from Talvin's exhilarating tabla percussion, before being 
delectably spliced and diced in post-production.**"**
