<p id="introduction"> This morning we are still confined and condemned to look at the sky behind our windows. Luckily Jeffrey Silverstein is here to guide us on a peaceful hike in the heart of our inner mountain. Time to lie down and breathe slowly, it's up to everyone to draw the landscapes that will allow them to escape.

# Jeffrey Silverstein's selection

## Ted Lucas - It's So Easy
Jeffrey: **"**A simple, beautiful folk song by the late Detroit Musician Ted Lucas. Ted's work had a big impact on how I approached putting together my new LP, You Become the Mountain. One of the most comforting songs and albums I've ever known.<br>
Favorite lyrics:
<i>"We've got to trust each other blindly<br>
Only then will we have eyes to see<br>
What we make of love it never comes easy<br>
Our hearts are tempered by adversity."</i>**"**

## Michael Hurley - Knockando
Jeffrey: **"**Michael Hurley is a living legend and I'm still blown away I get to watch him perform as often as I do in Portland. This might be the first song I ever heard of his. My buddy John Andrews (Woods, Quilt, Cut Worms, Hand Habits) turned me onto his work years ago and I've been more or less obsessed ever since.<br>
Favorite lyrics:
<i>"You are fire<br>
The spirit fire<br>
Your soul is burning good<br>
Can you hear the cracklin' heart<br>
Of the old pinewood"</i>**"**

## Elyse Weinberg - Houses (with Neil Young)
Jeffrey: **"**'Houses', from Late 60's song-writer Elyse Weinberg's 1968 record Elyse has since been covered by Vetiver, Dinosaur Jr. and Courtney Barnett. The original version here has Neil Young on it. The quality of her voice and the raw production quality always drew me to this one. <br>
Favorite lyrics:
<i>"I could never lie down in your ditch<br>
You would never want to in mine<br>
Even if we were both well meant and<br>
High born in another time"</i>**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jeffrey Silverstein - A Dog's Age
Jules: **"**[Jeffrey Silverstein](https://jeffreysilverstein.bandcamp.com/)**"**

## Angad Berar - Anjuna
Jules: **"**[Angad Berar](https://angadberar.bandcamp.com/)**"**

## Green House - Parlor Palm
Jules: **"**[Green House](https://green-house.bandcamp.com/)**"**

## Rideau - Le Ciel, le Soleil et la Mer
Jules: **"**Taken from [Mausolée Tape 5](https://souterraine.biz/album/mausol-e-tape-5), a compilation of covers of Jean-Luc Le Ténia songs led by Gajeb and published on the label La Souterraine, this song is my favorite of the moment, I listen to it every morning while looking at the sky.**"**
