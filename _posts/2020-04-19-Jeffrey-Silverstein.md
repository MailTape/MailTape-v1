# Jeffrey Silverstein's selection

## Ted Lucas - It's So Easy
Jeffrey: **"**A simple, beautiful folk song by the late Detroit Musician Ted Lucas. Ted's work had a big impact on how I approached putting together my new LP, You Become the Mountain. One of the most comforting songs and albums I've ever known.<br>
Favorite lyrics:
<i>"We've got to trust each other blindly<br>
Only then will we have eyes to see<br>
What we make of love it never comes easy<br>
Our hearts are tempered by adversity."</i>**"**

## Michael Hurley - Knockando
Jeffrey: **"**Michael Hurley is a living legend and I'm still blown away I get to watch him perform as often as I do in Portland. This might be the first song I ever heard of his. My buddy John Andrews (Woods, Quilt, Cut Worms, Hand Habits) turned me onto his work years ago and I've been more or less obsessed ever since.<br>
Favorite lyrics:
<i>"You are fire<br>
The spirit fire<br>
Your soul is burning good<br>
Can you hear the cracklin' heart<br>
Of the old pinewood"</i>**"**

## [Safia Nolin](https://safianolin.bandcamp.com/) & Pomme - Lesbian Break-Up Song
Philémon: **"**J'adore Safia et Pomme. Ce sont des chanteuses incroyables. Toutes deux si différentes dans leur voix, mais si belles à leur façon. Il y a une légèreté et même une liberté qui sortent de leur bouche quand elles chantent. Je sais pas comment dire ça. Quand Pomme chante, mon corps se détend instantanément. Et quand Safia chante, mon corps se détend instantanément. Et je suis hypnotisé. Et je veux rester dans ce lieu. Deux lieux différents, incomparables. Mais tous deux indispensables. J'ai donc choisi cette chanson, parce que là, en plus, elles chantent ensemble. Mais ensemble ou séparément, c'est tout aussi beau. Et ce sont de grandes compositrices de chansons aussi.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Philémon Cimon](https://philemoncimon.bandcamp.com/) - Latte Chumey
Jules: **"**My favorite Philémon song remains "Les Pommiers Envahis" (go listen to [it](https://philemoncimon.bandcamp.com/track/les-pommiers-envahis)!), but as I already included it in [Corte Real's MailTape episode](https://www.mailta.pe/380/corte-real/) I decided to listen to his fourth album "PAYS" again. This song talks about the sweet simplicity of everyday life, romances that bloom and fade, memories that survive the passing of time.**"**

## [Kacey Johansing](https://kaceyjohansing.bandcamp.com/) - wildfire (Hand Habits cover)
Jules: **"**Hand Habits wrote "wildfire" during the California Wildfires in 2017. Being aware of the consequences of climate change while on tour and admitting himself that being a musician and traveling the world for concerts for three quarters of the year is not the most environmentally friendly way of life, the singer-songwriter chose 5 artists to make a cover of this song for the [Wildfire compilation](https://handhabits.bandcamp.com/album/wildfire-covers), which is donating all of its profits to the Amazon Conservation Association. All of the covers are great but this one from Kacey Johansing has somthing special to me.**"**

## SAULT - Threats
Jules: **"**We don't know much about this mysterious group coming from England and simply called SAULT, which has suddenly released two albums in 2019. Next to all of their hits, great mixes of new wave and indie soul, there are also slower ballads like this one, taken from their second album [7](https://saultglobal.bandcamp.com/album/7).**"**

## Helado Negro - Todo Lo Que Me Falta
Jules: **"**This song is taken from ["This Is How You Smile"]( https://heladonegro.bandcamp.com/album/this-is-how-you-smile), Miami-born, New York-based artist Roberto Carlos Lange's sixth album. I have a preference for his Spanish-lyrics songs, and this one is perfect for taking the time to think about what you could do today.**"**
