<p id="introduction">This morning, we are happy to welcome [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) to select three Sunday morning songs with us. 

Based in Brooklyn, New York, [Floam](https://www.floammusic.com/) is pushing into experimental musical/[visual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXTREURD74) territory. Self proclaimed "bouncy rock" musicians, Floam blends a host of influences into a neat, new sound.

# Floam's selection

## Margo Guryan - Sunday Morning
Floam: **"**This one is a little on the nose, but it's a recent favorite. It's a radiant song about love on Sunday morning, and the production is a journey that is a joy each time.**"**

## [Devonté Hynes](https://bloodorangenyc.bandcamp.com/) and [Connan Mockasin](https://connanmockasin.bandcamp.com/) - Feelin' Lovely
Floam: **"**Devonté Hynes (aka Blood Orange) and Connan are two favorites of ours and their collaborative EP from 2015 is a gem. Feelin' Lovely is snappy and scribbly and good for you and the rest of your day!**"** 

## [Khruangbin](https://khruangbin.bandcamp.com/) - Evan Finds The Third Room
Floam: **"**Khruangbin's sound is open and organic and playful and raw. Start your morning with affirmations (the repeated "yes!" in the track) for an energetic day.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) – Thinking Back
Sarah: **"**The bossa nova groove in the beginning of this track drew me in first, and then throughout the rest of the song, Floam's guitarist does everything right. The mix on *Thinking Back* makes such an interesting balance of rock influences, modern jazz, and experimental production methods. Listen for the break  towards the end of this song, it brings the track to a whole new level. As with all of Floam's discography, Thinking Back is smooth.**"**

## [Schwey](https://www.facebook.com/schweyluv/) – Elasto
Sarah: **"**Coming off of Schwey's 2019 album, funk-infused instrumentals are striking and yet polished into this track. The intensity of the vocals and instrumentals build so naturally, Schwey creates a song you can melt into listening.**"**

## [Snoh Aalegra](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3934926-Snoh-Aalegra) – FEELS
Sarah: **"**Retro energy and Snoh Aalegra's vocals make such a refreshing mix, it's perfect for getting yourself out of bed in the morning.**"**

## [TOPS](https://tops.bandcamp.com/) – I Feel Alive
Sarah: **"**The movement on this track is absolutely contagious. Are you feeling alive on this fine Sunday morning? Are you going to dance in your bedroom? Will you have ice cream for breakfast? Will you wear mismatching socks and slide on some hardwood floors? I hope you do all of the above, and you treat yourself to a great Sunday :)**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thank you so much for listening with us. Thank you to Floam for this sunshine selection, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for this episode's fantastic illustration.</p>
