<p id="introduction">This morning, we're not letting winter take our energy. It's cold but our hearts are warmer than ever. And with Minuit Machine as our guests, prepare for a journey through a selection of energetic and cathartic tracks. Open, open, open, make a big O and keep searching.

# Minuit Machine's selection

## [Doppelhandel](https://doppelhandel.bandcamp.com/album/obverse) - Billy 
Minuit Machine: **"**I just discovered this band and I had a crush on that song! It's retro but somehow modern, and very soothing.**"**

## [Tallisker](https://tallisker.bandcamp.com/track/somewhere) - Somewhere
Minuit Machine: **"**Definitely the soundtrack of my summer! It reminds me of a warm and lazy Sunday at the beach. I love listening to it when I feel nostalgic and that I miss the sun.**"**

## [Panterah](https://panterah.bandcamp.com/album/discover) - Discover
Minuit Machine: **"**We toured in North America with this artist in October and she's amazing. Her performance on stage is also mind-blowing!**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Minuit Machine](https://minuitmachine.bandcamp.com/) - Contradictions
ImaCrea: **"**Techno is cathartic music by essence. And Minuit Machine masters that magic. Dark synth wave with rage outside and warm fragility inside. Their music is a subtle walk on a thin ridge looking for *the* subliminal balance. We're made of contradictions, better accept it.**"**

## [Fever Ray](https://feverray.bandcamp.com/album/radical-romantics) - Carbon Dioxide
ImaCrea: **"**This voice. This voice. This voice !! I love Fever Ray's music so much. There's something instinctive and raw I can't describe clearly but her music always exhorts me to dance wildly. Can't tell how much I was happy to see she just released new tracks. And this one is a banger of course!**"**

## [Flèche Love](https://flechelove.bandcamp.com/album/naga-part-2) - Mitote
ImaCrea: **"**Explosion. Implosion. Exhale. Inhale. Grandios musica! Merci Caro pour la découverte (!).**"**

## [Dawuna](https://dawuna.bandcamp.com/) - Baby Boy
ImaCrea: **"**Love the deeply introspective atmosphere here. Unrolling as a spiral, this track rotates in my head while it digs up fictitious souvenirs of a dreamed past. As I walk and I look at the past, I see there's not only one story, one angle. As I keep walking and moving in the present towards some future, the past keeps changing also. *"L'homme est mouvement vers le monde et son semblable"*, Frantz Fanon.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! It's been 11 years (!). Much love to [Minuit Machine](https://minuitmachine.bandcamp.com/), and many thanks to [Noémie Dijon](https://noemiedijon.tumblr.com/) for her neon illustration!</p>
