This morning, be prepared for a shower of heart throbbing words and melodies that will pull your soul away from any puddles of sorrow. [Hugo Kepler](http://www.hugokepler.com/) chooses simplicity, transporting you to a land of sunset and white musk. But the sun is universal and we will be touched with heat rays of lyrical ambivalence, tempting you to light smiles of genuine contentment, guaranteed to feed empty desires.

# Water in the desert.
Quench your thirst for meaning and substance with the candid lyrics of John Grant, let yourself travel with the joyful cords of William Tyler and do not forget to grasp a minute of sensuality with the mesmerizing voice of Amarante. 

Are you still thirsty? Of course you are, it’s Sunday and ‘’Senza Mon Amour’’ I just can’t keep my ears of off you!! Kepler’ holding your hand, taking you for a tour of heat on chest and dilated pupils.

Take a last sip of your glass, we are in and out of decadence with Samay’s oriental groove drop. Digging for more, seems Maribou has dropped a love-flavored ice cube swirling around a gold straw from which an eruption of inspiration signed Tilman reminisces fun vibes, topping this selection of magical flavors with sass.

## John Grant - You don't have to
Hugo Kepler: **"**_I like the simplicity of the song. Almost no instruments. Just the voice, the melody, the words... Grant's lyrics are always disturbing and memorable.. They stick with you. You never expect what's coming next. "Because you think you're so fucking cool" ! It's such a childish thing to say !_**“**

## William Tyler - We can't go home again
HK: **"**_I bought this album in 2013. I used to play it when I was driving in Corsica. It made feel like I was on another planet. This track is timeless. This indian-like feeling makes it all the more mysterious. I like the way this track evolves, it's very well written._**"**

## Rodrigo Amarante - Mon Nom
HK: **"**_In this album all the melodies are super refined. This song is in french. The musicality of the brazilian accent adds something dreamy and melancholic. The lyrics are very intriguing... It's always thrilling to hear the story of a foreigner... You've got to love a guy who's comparing himself to an aubergine._**"**
