<p id="introduction">Today, we are delighted to welcome Bordeaux-based producer [Mydgar](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape. Mydgar is the solo project from electronic group Mozaik. Describing the studio as his home, releases of [Mydgar](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) are richly layered with retro detailing and synth exploration. Each album aims to create its own storyline from track to track, untethered to any particular genre. For this MailTape, Mydgar's selections each test the boundaries of electronic music, bringing movement into your Sunday morning.

# Mydgar's selection

## The Bongo Band - Apache
Raw Poetic: **"**This song is pretty well known in the B-Boy circuit, but I think it’s a quite necessary piece for anyone who is just learning about hip-hop or trying to learn how to rap. It’s a great beat to freestyle rap or dance to.  I feel like this song should be played at some point every day.**"**

## The Silent Years - Someone To Keep Us Warm
Raw Poetic: **"**I can’t remember if I played a gig with this band, or if I just saw them in DC one night; but they played this song, and I never forgot it. It has a good vibe. I believe they are from Detroit. I’m not sure if they even still exist as a band. I don’t know any of their other songs. But I like this one. It reminds me that anyone, in the right moment, can make a good song. As long as it’s from the heart.**"**

## MC Solaar - Bouge De Là
Raw Poetic: **"**My mother made me study French when I was a young boy, and my sister had taken a trip to France. Since she knew I loved hip-hop, my sister sent me back this French Hip-Hop album. At the time, I didn’t even know hip-hop was popular in France. I loved this song. It opened me up to a whole new world of hip-hop. I’ve been a fan ever since.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Raw Poetic](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) - Late Night
Sarah : **"**Love the punchy quality of these retro synths, something of a signature for Mydgar's releases. These movements underlay the space for the rest of the track's flight, weaving in between and underneath the percussives and lead synths. Mydgar's experimentation with drumming basslines (surrounding us all at once and then disappearing, only to move ahead with momentum once again) contribute to the melancholic energy within the track. Indeed, Mydgar describes how he wrote the track in one of the darkest periods of quarantine, and the melody reflects this headspace. However, toward the track's end, there seems to be a sort of revelation, the melancholy appears to lift, on its way to brighter places after a late night.**"**

## [Nikki Nair](https://nikkinair.bandcamp.com/) - The Analyst
Sarah: **"**Off of Nikki Nair's 2020 album, Scuzzy. Love the bold use of vocoder and punchy percussives; the experimentation with clanging synths to beat crescendo makes for such a surprising listening experience.**"**

## [Mozaik](https://www.facebook.com/wearemozaik/) - Assembly
Sarah: **"**The namesake of Mozaik's most recent EP (2021 release). The track maintains much of the standard club structure while also opening up opportunities for synth experimentation. A wonderful progression to listen through, we notice many of the signature elements seen in Mydgar's solo work (especially sharp analog synth leads to complement the waves of celestial synth work). Beaming basslines halfway through give new life to the mix, pushing it into powerful new ground.**"**

## [Soft Cell](https://www.softcell.co.uk/), [DJ Hell](https://www.discogs.com/artist/114532-Hell) - Tainted Love (DJ Hell Remix)
Sarah: **"**A familiar favorite reworked, balancing out our morning's playlist :) Love how the melody sneaks up on us, with patterned synthwork adding an ominous spin to the original; love the trance club pickup toward the track's end.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our thanks to [Mydgar](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) for this elevating electronic selection. Many thanks to Anthony Dujardin for this episode's wonderful illustration!</p>
