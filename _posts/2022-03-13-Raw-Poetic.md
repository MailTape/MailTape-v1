<p id="introduction">Today, we are delighted to welcome Bordeaux-based producer [Mydgar](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape. Mydgar is the solo project from electronic group Mozaik. Describing the studio as his home, releases of [Mydgar](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) are richly layered with retro detailing and synth exploration.

# Mydgar's selection

## The Bongo Band - Apache
Mydgar: **"**There is absolutely all the things I love in this track. Sometimes, when you produce music, you tend to add new elements to fill a lack of something instead of pushing one element and make it interesting. For me, in this track, Rival Consoles perfectly manages to sublimate the main lead with a super creative use and treats of it. It result a kind of minimalist track with the main lead as a guideline, I love it !**"**

## The Silent Years - Someone Keep Us Warm
Mydgar: **"**This track is epic and full of story, it brings a lot of images to my mind... that's exactly what I'm looking for when listening to or producing music, well done Melawati !**"**

## MC Solaar - Bouge De Là
Mydgar: **"**I really like this side project of Nicolas Jaar. It might sound a little harder to listen to but the more I listen to it the more I discover things in this track... it’s like a movie you need to see twice of more! The way he uses saturation and sampling in this track is completely unbelievable !**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Mydgar](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) - Late Night
Sarah : **"**Love the punchy quality of these retro synths, something of a signature for Mydgar's releases. These movements underlay the space for the rest of the track's flight, weaving in between and underneath the percussives and lead synths. Mydgar's experimentation with drumming basslines (surrounding us all at once and then disappearing, only to move ahead with momentum once again) contribute to the melancholic energy within the track. Indeed, Mydgar describes how he wrote the track in one of the darkest periods of quarantine, and the melody reflects this headspace. However, toward the track's end, there seems to be a sort of revelation, the melancholy appears to lift, on its way to brighter places after a late night.**"**

## [Nikki Nair](https://nikkinair.bandcamp.com/) - The Analyst
Sarah: **"**Off of Nikki Nair's 2020 album, Scuzzy. Love the bold use of vocoder and punchy percussives; the experimentation with clanging synths to beat crescendo makes for such a surprising listening experience.**"**

## [Mozaik](https://www.facebook.com/wearemozaik/) - Assembly
Sarah: **"**The namesake of Mozaik's most recent EP (2021 release). The track maintains much of the standard club structure while also opening up opportunities for synth experimentation. A wonderful progression to listen through, we notice many of the signature elements seen in Mydgar's solo work (especially sharp analog synth leads to complement the waves of celestial synth work). Beaming basslines halfway through give new life to the mix, pushing it into powerful new ground.**"**

## [Soft Cell](https://www.softcell.co.uk/), [DJ Hell](https://www.discogs.com/artist/114532-Hell) - Tainted Love (DJ Hell Remix)
Sarah: **"**A familiar favorite reworked, balancing out our morning's playlist :) Love how the melody sneaks up on us, with patterned synthwork adding an ominous spin to the original; love the trance club pickup toward the track's end.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our thanks to [Mydgar](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) for this elevating electronic selection. Many thanks to Anthony Dujardin for this episode's wonderful illustration!</p>
