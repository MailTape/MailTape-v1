<p id="introduction">This morning, we've got some smooth sunshine tracks to lift our spirits up, introduced by our dear guest, Raw Poetic. Based in the D.C. area, 
</p>

# Mydgar's selection

## [The Bongo Band](https://www.mrbongo.com/collections/incredible-bongo-band) - Apache
Raw Poetic: **"**This song is pretty well known in the B-Boy circuit, but I think it’s a quite necessary piece for anyone who is just learning about hip-hop or trying to learn how to rap. It’s a great beat to freestyle rap or dance to.  I feel like this song should be played at some point every day.**"**

## [The Silent Years](https://www.facebook.com/The-Silent-Years-28187101026/) - Someone To Keep Us Warm
Raw Poetic: **"**I can’t remember if I played a gig with this band, or if I just saw them in DC one night; but they played this song, and I never forgot it. It has a good vibe. I believe they are from Detroit. I’m not sure if they even still exist as a band. I don’t know any of their other songs. But I like this one. It reminds me that anyone, in the right moment, can make a good song. As long as it’s from the heart.**"**

## [MC Solaar](https://www.discogs.com/artist/16412-MC-Solaar) - Bouge De Là
Raw Poetic: **"**My mother made me study French when I was a young boy, and my sister had taken a trip to France. Since she knew I loved hip-hop, my sister sent me back this French Hip-Hop album. At the time, I didn’t even know hip-hop was popular in France. I loved this song. It opened me up to a whole new world of hip-hop. I’ve been a fan ever since.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Raw Poetic](https://mydgar.bandcamp.com/) - Cadillac
Sarah : **"**such a beautiful track 
coming off of a difficult relationship, coming to peace with the end
a proper goodbye
watery quality with reverberating bass and smooth vocals, contrasting so nicely with the higher guitar riff comp
a testament to the "Jason-ness" of this album 
	hip hop, folk w soul elements, but not lingering too long on any one genre
**"**  

## [Damu the Fudgemunk, Raw Poetic](https://nikkinair.bandcamp.com/) - Power of the Mind
Sarah: **"**One of the many collaborations between Damu the Fudgemunk and Raw Poetic, this track is lifted from their 
xylophone
love the bursts of vocals, injecting the song with easy energy; a nice track. Love the piano opening towards the end, smooooth :)**"**

## [Raw Poetic](https://www.facebook.com/wearemozaik/) - Moving Maps, Tulips
Sarah: **"**Raw Poetic is dominating this playlist, but there was simply too much to choose from. This track is another collaboration with Damu the Fudgemunk, featuring jazz legend Archie Shepp on sax. Raw Poetic describes the production process of this album as free form, where each**"**
