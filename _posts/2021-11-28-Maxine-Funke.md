<p id="introduction"> This morning, we welcome our guest [Lael Neale](https://laelneale.bandcamp.com/album/acquainted-with-night) with a delicate and pacifying MailTape. This calming selection is an invitation to slow down, a guided introspection as we truly listen to both the music and ourselves.
<br><br>
As the world continues to open its doors back to the endless forms of entertainment and constant distractions once perceived as necessary elements of life, we must not forget the simplicity of existing we were recently welcomed to so dearly cherish.
<br><br>
Today’s MT is an ode to sensitivity, an allegiance to the core and a devotion to clarity. Lael Neale’s delicate yet persuasive voice carries a message of faith and confidence delivered in this floating composition. Her song, White Wings, will linger with you for days, like the long embrace from the reassuring stranger you’ve waited on for years.

# Maxine Funke's selection

##  Joan Baez - A Simple Twist of Fate
Maxine Funke: **"**I chose a simple twist of fate because I admire how it flows chronologically, it has more than 3 verses which always impresses me.**"**

##  Jennifer Warnes - Let the Sunshine In
Maxine Funke: **"**really like it when jennifer warnes sings:

Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

I can relate to that. always having to give up book reading time to find or do work, so my books become the dying nation of paper fantasy. Keeping an ear out for the news which is questionable. And then getting inspired to write a song, which is like a lonely tune because I am not popular in NZ.**"**

## Robert Wyatt - Ship Building
Maxine Funke: **"**ship building, just an old favourite of mine. It really transports me . I like how it's made of pieces of conversation, so you are immediately drawn in. There's no description of the setting but the setting is so potent in the song. I admire that.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Maxine Funke - Equinox
Sarah: **"**Maxine Funke's work has such a peaceful quality surrounding it, especially fitting for a song written about the restful hours of the morning. Her voice cradles the very air it traverses, balancing the rounded dissonances of her guitar's melodies. In her description of the release, Maxine also explains that while writing this sortie, she felt struck by the hymn [Be Still My Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqgC1tqifV8) and several Robert Louis Stevenson poems.  **"**

## Luiza Brina Chico Bernardes - Garrafa ao Mar
Sarah: **"**The sweeping synths bring a delicate, yet celestial quality to this track. With each measure, we're lifted a little higher off the ground. Chico Bernardes and Luiza Brina's vocals weave in and out of each others' so gently, the most pleasant anchor for the aerial experience offered by the instrumentals. Love the departure into slightly more saturated, buffering instrumentals toward the end.**"**

## Nala Sinephro - Space 5
Sarah: **"**Coming from her first album released on Warp Records, this London-based artist shapes sound as a sculptor would work with clay. Jazz and ambient making love together, I've been waiting to hear something like this for a while and each track is a perfect gem. There's no need for VR by lord Mark when one has such an imagination opener. An artist to watch closely, the beginning of a beautiful story.**"**

## Maxine Funke - Homage
Sarah: **"**Couldn't resist adding another Maxine Funke release to round out this playlist.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thank you so much for being with us. So much love to Lael Neale for her meditative Sunday selections and Meriam Kharbat for her splendid illustration.</p>
