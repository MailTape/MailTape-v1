<p id="introduction">INTRO, take my hand</p>

# nice tities, hmm title
 
some nice text here

# Seoul's morning inspiration
 
## Wildkatz - John Waters 
_Milo Mc Bride:_ **"**Nomadic beatsmith / innovative vagabond , Wildkatz produces various styles and flavors. In "John Waters" , he uses this sample with such ease - even though disjointed and asymmetric, it flows like butter. **"**
 
## Abu Ashley - Hussein Online (Habibi Mix)
_Milo Mc Bride:_ **"**Now living in Berlin, Abu Ashley makes house and techno that relates back his Egyptian roots in Port Said. His first release for [Pa-rka] Records included this gem - "Hussein Online". Between the pulsating bass and soothing pads, the track has great vibes (also worth peeping the video).**"**
 
## Ghost Town DJ's - My Boo
_Milo Mc Bride:_ **"**NY based video artist and photographer, Minister Akins also makes some really soulful music. Just when the wall of ambience in "Holy Communion" puts you at peace - the sub falls in and the energy starts flowing forward. A great way to start a set or even your morning playlist.**"**
