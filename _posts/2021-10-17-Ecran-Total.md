# Ecran Total's selection

## [Robert Wyatt](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wyatt) - Sea Song
Camille: **"**C’est un artiste que j’ai découvert à l’âge de 16 ans, que j’écoute et qui m’inspire toujours autant. Ce morceau est issu d’un album qu’il a composé à l’hôpital. C’est très sombre et en meme temps plein de lumière.**"**

## [Mathieu Boogaerts](https://mathieuboogaerts.com/) - Super
Margaux: **"**J’ai écouté l’album Super 2 en boucle. Il est super mélancolique et drôle. Sa poésie, son bricolage sonore me parle beaucoup, et j’ai l’impression de suivre ses hallucinations.**"**

## [Bigott](https://bigottband.bandcamp.com/album/pavement-tree) - Pavement Tree
Camille & Margaux: **"**C’est un artiste espagnol que Camille a découvert. « Le Johnny Cash castillan ». Il a quelque chose de naïf que Margaux aime bien. On est en train d'en travailler une reprise.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Écran Total](https://ecrantotalmusique.bandcamp.com) - Finie la fête
ImaCrea: **"**Such an instant crush. Irresistible groove. Simple undulating drum accompanied by a hazy trumpet in the back... and such a hypnotizing voice! That's the track that got me into Écran Total. Then I listened to their album, [Schaerbeek Love](https://ecrantotalmusique.bandcamp.com/album/schaerbeek-love), in a loop so many times. Particularly perfect on a train trip I found. Takes you from vibrant to mellow places while being always groovy, a soft and colorful introspective experience you can bring with you on the dancefloor.**"**

## [Юлия Накарякова](https://iuliia-nakariakova.bandcamp.com/album/-) - Здравствуй
ImaCrea: **"**I can't really remember how I found out about Iuliia Nakariakova but I can clearly remember the sun rays full of happiness and hope spread from the speakers to my heart the first time I listened to her. I find in this particular track something LCD Sound System..ish in a way. Raw drums, not so perfect rhythm but deeply human-like I love it with a slightly distorted pop synth. Intensity goes up and up, her voice becoming more and more present, till a great lively climax.**"**

## [Yellow Magic Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Magic_Orchestra) - Rydeen
ImaCrea: **"**Feels like being a knight riding a horse in a motherboard futuristic kind of landscape. That was 1979. Only analog synth and pure mastery. The beginning of an era, coming from the great land of Japan. I chose it also as a reflection of Écran Total eponymous track which depicts some of today's disillusions about this utopian future made of electronic waves people used to believe in the '80s. And, even though this era is somehow fading away, this track still bangs so hard. You can count on it at any moment when in need of positive energy to cheer you up, no matter what. If you love it, as I do, check [this live version](https://youtube.076.ne.jp/watch?v=9OQ-b2l-NCk) they did in Greece back then.**"**

## [Black Moth Super Rainbow](https://blackmothsuperrainbow.bandcamp.com) - Melody For Color Spectrum
ImaCrea: **"**Sooooo.... After the intensity of YMO, let's put our feet back on earth. But where are we? Trees are gently vibrating and nature is becoming one with you, welcome to the trippy universe of Black Moth Super Rainbow. And then, as I look around and breathe slowly, I realize...**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! It's been more than 10 years now and you're still with us, you're as much crazy as us and we love that!
