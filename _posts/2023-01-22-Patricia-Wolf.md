# Patricia Wolf's selection

## [Carmen Villain](https://carmenvillain.bandcamp.com/) - Portals
Patricia Wolf: **"**I chose this song for its dreamy, delicate atmosphere. One of the things I love best about Sunday mornings is that I can let myself sleep in as long as I want. I can let myself indulge in the strange innerworld of my psyche and let dreams reach their conclusions. This song feels like a portal to a secret inner world saturated in mystery and emotion. With this song I'd like to ask the listener - What did you dream about and what do you think it meant? Did you enjoy it or was it stressful? Did you get emotional closure for something unresolved in your life? Are you being haunted by a memory or unrealized desire?**"**

## [Natalie Beridze](https://room40.bandcamp.com/album/of-which-one-knows) - Drift 
Patricia Wolf: **"**This song feels like the benevolent part of one's psyche that's communicating to you through a dream. It feels like one's ancestors holding you, teaching you, asking you what you have learned and hoping that you don't make the same mistakes as they did. There's compassion and encouragement there. It transcends conventional language and appears as a message embedded in one's DNA and energy connections that we don't understand, but sense. It leaves us with a mysterious and wondrous impression as we wake and greet the new day.**"**

## [UMAN](https://umanspirit.bandcamp.com/) - Atmosphère
Patricia Wolf: **"**This song feels like the moment one wakes up. It's a gentle step out of one's dreams into waking life while feeling a surge of energy gently enter your body and mind. It's an invitation to dance from the bedroom to the kitchen to make coffee and banana pancakes.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Patricia Wolf](https://patriciawolf.bandcamp.com/) - Springtime in Croatia
ImaCrea: **"**Patricia Wolf is guiding us through a path I walked by too rarely when listening to music. And I love it. Her delicate and subtle music evokes a precious feeling of empathy with one's surroundings. Something one may find when out far away from urban landscapes on a meditative walk.**"**

## [Adela Mede](https://adelamede.bandcamp.com) - Gyöngyvirág
ImaCrea: **"**The dream goes on, let's keep on flying. Adela Mede incorporates a trinity of languages in her music: English, Slovak, and Hungarian. A deep and daring project which is pushing further the frontiers of ambient. Can't wait to discover her next work. Very promising.**"**

## [Sam Gendel](https://samgendel.bandcamp.com) - Tate-waku (竪沸く, rising steam)
ImaCrea: **"**I've been listening to this album on repeat so many times since it got released last autumn. Sam Gendel keeps amazing me. I see this album as an hommage to Miles Davis "Kind of blue". Respect and true love here.**"**

## [Félicia Atkinson](https://feliciaatkinson.bandcamp.com) - Image Langage
ImaCrea: **"**I'm finding more and more pleasure as I listen to Félicia Atkinson's music. And her latest album makes no exception. A vast universe to explore. Every time I listen, I hear something new. I find there's a depth of beautiful complexity that is subtly encapsulated into a harmonious veil. And as one's untangles this complexity after listening to it again and again, things start to reassemble mentally into a new logic. This is "open" music, in the sense of Rilke's "Ô".**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Much respect and love to [Patricia Wolf](https://patriciawolf.bandcamp.com/), and many thanks to Lucie Fléty for her charming illustration!</p>
