<p id="introduction">This morning, [Kid Koala](https://www.facebook.com/KidKoala/?fref=ts) awakens the rooster in you. The sunbeams shine through the blinds. Nature, which doesn't need any alarm to wake up, comes to its senses. The light breaks through the chicken coop and we start the day on a Henhouse Five Plus Too's symphony.
Some chickens get up a bit later, trying to get on their feet, slipping on the barn's ground just as a scratch in Kid Koala's song. Meanwhile, others catch up with the Muppets Show's choir where the best giggler of them all meet. However, a closer look reveals that a henhouse forms a well organised community when you listen carefully to the outward chaos we usually see as humans.</p>

# The Beauty & The Beast

Looking out the barn, we can see the whole nature revealing itself in a new light. Every flower turns to the sun. The Twin Sisters thrust us into this wild meadow still blank from human exploitation, a little piece of heaven just for us. Here, no one is a Caged Animal(s), boredom hits the ones who has still its narrow spirit, their vision restricted by blinders their whole life. However, after a few minutes, everything lightens up and every detail uncovers gradually. Such beauty fixed into our animal side that nothing can beat, not even the crazy futurist and slow robotisation of humankind. In Neon Indian, even humanoids will discover the emotion and passion for the last women alive... We will end this episode listening to Carte Blanche in tribute to DJ Mehdi who left us too soon. A major DJ who made us dream and dance, who will stay in our memories.

# Kid Koala's selection:

## Henhouse Five plus Two - Classical Cluck
_Kid Koala_: *"*This is my favorite song ever to be recorded by a choir of chickens. 4 part harmonies and even a cow introduction. Absolutely beautiful.*"*

## Kid Koala - Like Irregular Chickens
_Kid Koala_: *"*The phone rang in the studio in the middle of the take. I checked the caller ID and it caused an awkward gap in the recording... but when I listened back to it, it was amusing, so I kept it.*"*

## The Great Gonzo - The Blue Danube
_Kid Koala_: *"*This song has an amazing crescendo near the end. The tempo goes up about 1000 percent. This song will also make everyone on the dance floor go crazy... either that or leave.*"*

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Kid Koala](https://www.facebook.com/KidKoala/?fref=ts) for its crazy chikeny selection!</p>
