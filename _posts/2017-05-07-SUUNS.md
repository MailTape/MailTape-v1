<p id="introduction">This morning, wrap yourself in smooth, warm and soulful tracks, courtesy of [SUUNS](https://www.facebook.com/suunsband/ "Facebook"). SUUNS' music could be described as quite the opposite compared to their selection: ghostly and eerie sounds, sometimes unsettling or disquieting, but always well constructed, challenging and fascinating. Enjoy.</p>


# **SUUNS’ selection**

+ ## KING - The Greatest
_SUUNS_: **"**Shout out to Radwan from Jerusalem in My Heart for this one. Incredibly funky jam from a trio out of L.A.**"**

+ ## Lhasa de Sela - Love Came Here
_SUUNS_: **"**The greatest singer to come from Montreal. I saw her once. I was truly moved and perhaps changed forever. She has sadly passed but this song and her music is still resonant.**"**

+ ## Kadhja Bonet - Honeycomb
_SUUNS_: **"**Is this from L.A.? I think so. It's off a mysterious e.p. I got a month ago. Pretty awesome and soulful. I love musicians exploring music that is not attempting to be anything. Pure expression. I'm inspired. Happy Sunday.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## SUUNS - Bambi
_Inès_: **"**What I like the most about SUUNS' songs is their ghostly (almost paranoid) vibe and surprising song structure. It usually takes some time for me to really get into one of their songs, but I always go back to them (without knowing why) and end up being obsessed. I guess it's kind of a slowly constructed relationship over time, quite like this song and its great structure: starting up very coldly, it gets warmer and warmer throughout the song, only to drop again in the end, having some insane vocals (the canon!) in the middle.**"** 

+ ## Drea Vibe Dealer - Don't Obey
_Inès_: **"**Discovered while watching the [Brown Girls](http://www.browngirlswebseries.com/episodes/) webseries, I got immediately drawn to it. The slow and dreamy vibe mixed with the raw and communicative voice makes this song unexpectedly powerful.**"**

+ ## Arima Ederra - Artist Addiction
_Inès_: **"**Hypnotic production and smooth vocals. A song about unlimited, borderless faith through admiration.**"**

+ ## Helado Negro - It's My Brown Skin
_Inès_: **"**An ode to loving yourself and your skin, this song is very elegant and soothing. The way of singing, the repeating of words and the synths make it so comforting, much like being home under a blanket with a nice coffee, like nothing can hurt you.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [SUUNS](https://www.facebook.com/suunsband/ "Facebook") for their participation, and [Camille Célestin](http://www.slipontherock.com/ "Website") for the illustration. Have the gentlest of Sundays. </p>
