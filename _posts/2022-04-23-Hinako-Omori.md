# Hinako Omori's selection

## [Colleen](https://colleencolleen.bandcamp.com/album/the-tunnel-and-the-clearing) - Gazing at Taurus - Night Sky Rumba
Hinako Omori: **"**A meditative journey into Cécile’s beautiful sonic universe, with a driving drum machine loop teleporting and carrying us through clouds of synths rich with emotion, drifting through the nighttime sky…**"**

## [Madalyn Merkey](https://madalynmerkey.bandcamp.com/album/puzzle-music) - Pallet Fork
Hinako Omori: **"**Silky sonic threads weaving in and out of a magical tapestry of frequencies created by the incredible Madalyn Merkey - it’s as though you can reach out and feel the textures of the sounds if that makes sense…!**"**

## Musette - Coucou Anne
Hinako Omori: **"**This gorgeous song by Muzette is pure sunshine pouring through the clouds - it brightens my day every time I hear it. I first became aware of this lovely album on a trip to Berlin last year, and it takes me back to sunny walks and sunflowers in Neukölln :)**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Hinako Omori](https://hinakoomori.bandcamp.com/album/a-journey) - Ocean
ImaCrea : **"**Hinako Omori has created truly transporting sound helped with binaural waves and live field recording incorporated in her music. This track reminds me of the comforting feeling so special I experiment when going to see the sea. For the full experience, be sure to check her album freshly released ["A journey..."](https://hinakoomori.bandcamp.com/album/a-journey)**"**

## [OHYUNG](https://ohyung.bandcamp.com/album/imagine-naked-2) - yes my weeping frame!
ImaCrea: **"**The vibe here reminds me of music by [The Caretaker](https://thecaretaker.bandcamp.com/) or [Leya](https://leya.bandcamp.com). It feels like suspended in time, indefinitely oscillating like a rocking chair in a blurry memory.**"**

## [Del Stephen](https://delstephen.bandcamp.com/album/girolando) - Hoofbeats Echo
ImaCrea: **"**New track by Del Stephen! (remember [his episode](/479/Del-Stephen)?). What can I say? Listening to this track makes me think the world needs more acoustic guitars...**"**

## [Healion](https://naffrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/in-light-it-undoes-nothing) - About Breathing
ImaCrea: **"**Whatever I do, I can't resist too long before going back to electro. And this track is pure magic. I finish with this one as a gentle call to wake up and have a great day.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our warm thanks to [Hinako Omori](https://hinakoomori.bandcamp.com/album/a-journey) for her gentle selection. Many thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/) for this episode's illustration full of softness.</p>
