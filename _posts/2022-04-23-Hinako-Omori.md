# Hinako Omori' selection

## [Colleen](https://colleencolleen.bandcamp.com/album/the-tunnel-and-the-clearing) - Gazing at Taurus - Night Sky Rumba
Hinako Omori: **"**A meditative journey into Cécile’s beautiful sonic universe, with a driving drum machine loop teleporting and carrying us through clouds of synths rich with emotion, drifting through the nighttime sky…**"**

## [Madalyn Merkey](https://madalynmerkey.bandcamp.com/album/puzzle-music) - Pallet Fork
Hinako Omori: **"**Silky sonic threads weaving in and out of a magical tapestry of frequencies created by the incredible Madalyn Merkey - it’s as though you can reach out and feel the textures of the sounds, if that makes sense…!**"**

## Musette - Coucou Anne
Hinako Omori: **"**This gorgeous song by Muzette is pure sunshine pouring through the clouds - it brightens my day every time I hear it. I first became aware of this lovely album on a trip to Berlin last year, and it takes me back to sunny walks and sunflowers in Neukölln :)**"**
