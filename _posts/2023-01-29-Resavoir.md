<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are delighted to open our Sunday with dear guest, [Resavoir](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/resavoir). Band member and multi-instrumentalist Will Miller joins us for a careful selection of textured tracks. This sharing of new discoveries shines a moment of meditation on our Sunday morning :)

# Resavoir's selection

## [Hermeto Pascoal](https://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/) - Vou Esperar
Resavoir: **"**A striking and hauntingly beautiful instrumental piece from the Brazilian master multi-instrumentalist composer. He plays every instrument on this track- 7 flutes and an organ bass pedal. I love imagining him in the studio laying down track after track just perfectly executing this performance.**"**

## [Hypnotic Brass Ensemble](http://www.yoshihirohanno.com/discography/) and [Mick Karn](https://mickkarn.net/) - Now
Resavoir: **"**This is off an album called "Book of Sound" that's really terrific. The band is comprised of the sons of Kelan Phil Cohran who was himself a trumpet player and founding member of the AACM in Chicago. I love the way this record sounds, the way the overtones from the horns sort of distort the microphones, the combination of textures between the voices, horns, and bass, and the linear progression of the arrangement.**"**

## [Misha Panfilov Sound Combo](https://johnpowellmusic.com/) - Days as Echoes
Resavoir: **"**An ideal album for a sunday- cheerful, dreamy, beautiful, carefree, uplifting. Jazz waltz perfection. This album gets a lot of spins around my house.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Resavoir](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/album/any-day-now) - Plantasy
Sarah: **"**I love the power of this horn section, the chord progressions are sultry and wandering; weaving its own powerful narrative epic. A wonderful set of harmonies are made right before our ears, waning and waxing in surges of sound. The rest of the album is full of harmonic journeys and melodic traversions, but this track always puts me in a different space entirely.**"**

## [Frankie Reyes](https://omnigardens.bandcamp.com/) - En Mi Barrio
Sarah: **"**A surprising synth waltz from the 2020 album, Originalitos. **"**

## [North Americans](https://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/compositions-sorted.html) - Cutty
Sarah: **"**One of my favorite songs at the moment, from the 2018 release Going Steady. The guitar and droning synths together create a nomadic experience of void and drifting endlessness at once, fading away into the wind by the track's end.**"**

## [Healing Potpourri](https://elorisaxl.bandcamp.com/album/the-blue-of-distance) - Wind
Sarah: **"**Last track of this week! Such rousing movement and brightness in the vintage vocal line and retro keyboard backing. This track is from their 2022 album, Paradise. Love the psychedelic synths toward the end, excited to hear what's next from this group :)"**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up today's morning selection, thank you for joining us! Our love to Resavoir for these fantastic Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's wonderful illustration!</p>
