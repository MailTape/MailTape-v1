<p id="introduction">This morning, we are delighted to open our Sunday with dear guest, [Resavoir](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/resavoir). Band member and multi-instrumentalist Will Miller joins us for a careful selection of textured tracks. This sharing of new discoveries shines a moment of meditation on our Sunday morning :)

# Resavoir's selection

## [Hermeto Pascoal](https://hermetopascoal.bandcamp.com/) - Vou Esperar
Resavoir: **"**A striking and hauntingly beautiful instrumental piece from the Brazilian master multi-instrumentalist composer. He plays every instrument on this track- 7 flutes and an organ bass pedal. I love imagining him in the studio laying down track after track just perfectly executing this performance.**"**

## [Hypnotic Brass Ensemble](https://www.hypnoticbrassensemble.com/) - Now
Resavoir: **"**This song feels like the benevolent part of one's psyche that's communicating to you through a dream. It feels like one's ancestors holding you, teaching you, asking you what you have learned and hoping that you don't make the same mistakes as they did. There's compassion and encouragement there. It transcends conventional language and appears as a message embedded in one's DNA and energy connections that we don't understand, but sense. It leaves us with a mysterious and wondrous impression as we wake and greet the new day.**"**

## [Misha Panfilov Sound Combo](https://mpsc.bandcamp.com/album/days-as-echoes) - Days As Echoes
Resavoir: **"**This song feels like the moment one wakes up. It's a gentle step out of one's dreams into waking life while feeling a surge of energy gently enter your body and mind. It's an invitation to dance from the bedroom to the kitchen to make coffee and banana pancakes.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Resavoir](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/resavoir) - Plantasy
Sarah: **"**I love the power of this horn section, the chord progressions are sultry and wandering; weaving its own powerful narrative epic. A wonderful set of harmonies are made right before our ears, waning and waxing in surges of sound. The rest of the album is full of harmonic journeys and melodic traversing, but this track always puts me in a different space entirely.**"**

## [Frankie Reyes](https://stonesthrow.bandcamp.com/album/boleros-valses-y-mas-2) - En Mi Barrio
Sarah: **"**A surprising synth waltz from the 2020 album, Originalitos. Really like the restrained, graceful quality in the synthwork**"**

## [North Americans](https://northamericanszone.bandcamp.com/) - Cutty
Sarah: **"**One of my favorite songs at the moment, from the 2018 release Going Steady. The guitar and droning synths together create a nomadic experience of void and drifting endlessness at once, fading away into the wind by the track's end.**"**

## [Healing Potpourri](https://healingpotpourri.bandcamp.com/) - Wind
Sarah: **"**Last track of this week! Such rousing movement and brightness in the vintage vocal line and retro keyboard backing. This track is from their 2022 album, Paradise. Love the psychedelic synths toward the end, excited to hear what's next from this group :)".**"**
