<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are delighted to open our morning with  dear guest, [Resavoir](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/resavoir). Band member Will Miller joins us with a careful selection of textured tracks. This gift of new discoveries shines a moment of meditation on our Sunday morning.

# Resavoir's selection

## [Hermeto Pascoal](https://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/) - Vou Esperar
Resavoir: **"**A striking and hauntingly beautiful instrumental piece from the Brazilian master multi-instrumentalist composer. He plays every instrument on this track- 7 flutes and an organ bass pedal. I love imagining him in the studio laying down track after track just perfectly executing this performance.**"**

## [Hypnotic Brass Ensemble](http://www.yoshihirohanno.com/discography/) and [Mick Karn](https://mickkarn.net/) - Now
Resavoir: **"**This is off an album called "Book of Sound" that's really terrific. The band is comprised of the sons of Kelan Phil Cohran who was himself a trumpet player and founding member of the AACM in Chicago. I love the way this record sounds, the way the overtones from the horns sort of distort the microphones, the combination of textures between the voices, horns, and bass, and the linear progression of the arrangement.**"**

## [Misha Panfilov Sound Combo](https://johnpowellmusic.com/) - Days as Echoes
Resavoir: **"**An ideal album for a sunday- cheerful, dreamy, beautiful, carefree, uplifting. Jazz waltz perfection. This album gets a lot of spins around my house.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Resavoir](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/album/any-day-now) - Plantasy
Sarah: **"**r mccarthy's weaving synth work throughout this track shifts and builds so effortlessly, it seems to hover in air. The sparse percussives and hovering synth harmonies slide alongside each other with so much grace -- engulfing us in blanketed textures woven into soft vocals. The slightly distorted lead synth toward the track's end flows so well across the walls of rounded synth harmonies below it, it's entrancing. The rest of the [2017 release](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/album/dick-arkive-issue-2)continues this balanced freshness in production, look out for [Jyoti](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/track/jyoti) :).**"**

## [Brendan Eder Ensemble](https://omnigardens.bandcamp.com/) - QX 2021
Sarah: **"**This track brings us to another world, brimming with the filminess of green underwater flora, stretching upwards to a speckled surface in the distance. I used this track in my play for brainscape and aquascaping scenes, the harmonies here transport you to the swaying micro worlds of green and growth. (side note: r mccarthy's [Jyoti](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/track/jyoti) also featured to give a sounded body to this otherworldly space). The synth work's exploratory melody along with the droning hums of these undertones feel healing in some sense, like you're growing roots and new leaves just by listening to it -- living a newfound peaceful life as a patch of algae :)**"**

## [Paul Lansky](https://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/compositions-sorted.html) - Her Voice
Sarah: **"**On our last class of the semester, my music professor introduced us to Paul Lansky's [exploratory](http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/liner_notes/fantasies.html) 1994 album, [Fantasies and Tableaux](https://www.newworldrecords.org/products/paul-lansky-fantasies-and-tableaux). This is the first track off the release, and after listening through the rest of the collection, it's still my favorite ([Her Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lppSwmBBmOk) is a close second). The production process here is interesting, Paul Lansky uses his wife's voice as a technical instrument for the entire piece (bassline, chords, etc.), producing some of the synthwork with linear predictive coding. I love the haunting quality of his resulting product, approaching the uncanny valley of voice but still with the underlying romantic context to make me smile.**"**

## [Elori Saxl](https://elorisaxl.bandcamp.com/album/the-blue-of-distance) - Moss II
Sarah: **"**The fleeting power and playfulness of the sax sways in conversation with itself, at once ancient and evolving. I am reminded, maybe by the title, of my favorite recurring dream, where the moss reclaims me into its beautiful humming world of green. (Patches of carpet moss, strictly speaking... there's a film of mist all around and overhead, hosting a peaceful and insulated string of moments -- the moss has little green hands that embrace my arms as if it's been ages, and all that can be seen are these bright green stretches of softness welcoming me back... the image might be from reading too much Seamus Heaney, especially [this poem](https://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/poems/heaney/personal_helicon.php) and the last stanza of [this one](https://irelandtour.sunygeneseoenglish.org/resources/poems/heaneys-the-strand-at-lough-beg/).) Elori Saxl's epic arrives from [Touchtheplants](https://www.touchtheplants.com/pages/info)' 2021 album [Sound Wonders: A Series of Epics](https://www.touchtheplants.com/products/sound-wonders-lp), a compilation that includes several other wonderful artists including harpist [Nailah Hunter](https://nailahhunter.bandcamp.com/) and [SK Kakraba](https://skkakraba.bandcamp.com/). Elori Saxl's [description](https://www.touchtheplants.com/products/sound-wonders-lp) of her contribution in the album's release details a certain binding to the moss, where she explains how she felt, sitting on a bed of moss in a shaded forrest, that "the world was pulsing all around me and I never wanted it to end" but she also was "very aware that it was already slipping away."**"**
