<p id="introduction">This morning long-time jazz wayfarer Nick Woodmansey's [Emanative](https://emanative.bandcamp.com/) picks his three tracks for MailTape, to start our day with a groove-laden selection of sounds.</p>
<p>Three years after the brilliant [Light Years of Darkness](https://stevereidfoundation.bandcamp.com/album/the-light-years-of-the-darkness) LP on Brownswood Recordings, Emanative makes a welcome return on the self-released limited 7″, [Ominous Shanti/Black Enchantment](https://emanative.bandcamp.com/album/ominous-shanti). As usual, Nick performs with some of the finest musicians on the London scene at the moment – this time with another MailTape guest, [Sarathy Korwar](https://www.mailta.pe/249/sarathy-korwar/), as well as Tamar (Collocutor) Osborn, Suman Joshi, Ben Hadwen, Simon Finch and Jessica Lauren.</p>

# Afro space jazz rave

<p>There’s a power in tapping into different sounds and talents, which Emanative harnesses well, with unfettered collaboration at the heart of its musical aesthetic. Joining the dots between talented musicians and fresh ideas allows for a colourful output, paving the way for free-flowing experimentation with a broad spectrum of influence.</p>
<p>Float through this constellation of tracks with us, reaching for the cornerstones of Nick's sonic universe.</p>

# Emanative's selection


## Maleem Mahmoud Ghania with Pharoah Sanders - Mahraba
_Emanative_: **"**Peaceful and healing trance-like music with Guembri (a Morrocan stringed and skinned bass-like instrument) percussion, chanting and Pharoah Sanders, what more do you need?**"**

## Sun Ra - Sleeping Beauty
_Emanative_: **"**I would find it impossible to pick a favourite from Sun Ra, but if I had to this might well be one of them – equally perfect for both a late night lullaby as it is for Sunday morning chilled out vibes.**"**

## Johnny Dyani Witchdoctor's Son - Magwaza
_Emanative_: **"**I'm loving any records I hear featuring South African double bassist Johnny Dyani. This Witchdoctor's Son record is an Emanative favourite. Again it is the hypnotic bass, chanting and percussion. Check also his work with Abdullah Ibrahim, Don Cherry and Turkish drummer/percussionist, Okay Temiz.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Emanative - Ominous Shanti
_Sanjay_: **"**Emanative returns with its signature haze. Here, "Ominous Shanti" has the horns gradually melting in the heat while the lilting percussion keeps the groove in the pocket.**"**

## Idris Ackamoor & The Pyramids - Rhapsody In Berlin (Part 1)
_Sanjay_: **"**After studying with free-jazz pianist Cecil Taylor, the Pyramids left for a journey through Africa in 1972 where they developed their own musical vision. On Rhapsody in Berlin this vision is still vibrating; a melodic horn nestles with a Pygmy flute, some driving riffs and a heavy funk rhythm. If you look out for Part 2, the rhapsody explodes and the saxophone takes off before merging into an ecstasy of percussion. And if you're in London on Wednesday, [just go and see them!](http://theoldqueenshead.com/whats-on/earmusic-2-2017-08-02/)**"**

## Yazz Ahmed - Jamil Jamal
_Sanjay_: **"**If you're of the means to buy physical products, the beautiful illustrations, calligraphy and Yazz's own entertaining sleeve notes make this a worthy purchase before even getting to the music. And it's just as good. The alternating seven-eight percussive metre in Jamil Jamal is set up by a Rhodes and electric bass pulse, with slowly unfolding improvisations from Yazz's flugelhorn and bass clarinettist Shabaka Hutchings. For our friends in Paris, Yazz's ensemble will be at the [Blue Note Festival](http://www.bluenotefestival.fr/) in November.**"**

## Burnt Sugar Arkestra - If There's A Hell Below
_Sanjay_: **"**There are so many reasons to love the [Burnt Sugar Arkestra](http://burntsugarindex.com/), but I may be here a while if I was to list all of them! Evolving over time into a sprawling ensemble that takes its cues from Sun Ra, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as Jimi Hendrix and electric Miles, this is their brilliant head-bopping version of the Curtis Mayfield classic, Voices.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thanks to [Emanative](https://twitter.com/emanative) for his grooving selections, Daisy for the introduction and  [William Girault](http://williamgirault.com/) for this episode's illustration. Pray for sun/rain (whichever you need most of!).</p>
