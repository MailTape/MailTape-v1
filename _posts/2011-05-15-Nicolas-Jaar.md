<p id="introduction">This morning, [Nicolas Jaar](https://www.facebook.com/Nicolas-Jaar-15727540611/) is inviting you to embark on a psychedelic journey with “The Electric Prunes”.
In reality, we are still dreaming, and this is only the start of our journey. “Al Green” is now taking your hand, painting the most idyllic, eye-catching scenery. To the sound of “Nas” our eyes finally open, allowing us to slowly motion out of bed to some samples of “James Brown”.</p>

# Jump and fly

The noise of a motor echoes through the window, seems “Laid Back” are waiting for us with their plane, inviting us to a skydiving session. Free falling, the voice of "Erykah Badu" transports us to a space navel. Elbow leaning against the porthole, orbiting around the moon, we now see her, revealing her face, beginning to sing a single from “Man Man”. Our eyes open-up once more, is it a dream or reality? No importance, since “Danger Mouse” and “Jack White” are in the living room, waiting for us with a cup of coffee.

# Nicolas Jaar's selection:
