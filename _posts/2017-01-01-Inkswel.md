# Inkswel's selection

+ ## Mario & Malice Sweet - Superstar (produced by Tall black guy)
_Inkswel_: **"**Found these guys through TBG soundcloud originally, but have become a huge fan of this couple doing dope music together! this joint is such a sunday morning summer jam and its also produced by TBG so its heat from start to finish! Want to work with these guys so bad! Holla!**"**

+ ## 30/70 Collective- The Strut
_Inkswel_: **"**Melbourne bad ass shit right here! these guys are going to be huge! The next generation of future soul music from aussie shores with a concious blueprint! So much love!**"**

+ ## Selah Sue- I Wont Go For Mine (MNDSGN REMIX)
_Inkswel_: **"**This is just feel good music in its essence. Amazing new talent of up and coming pop talent Selah Sue but paired with one of the dopest producers in the game right now. This really shows that when a vocalist gets paired with a dope producer it brings out the best in their work! Vibes!**"**

# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Inkswel - Together (feat. Colonel Red)
_ImaCrea_: **"**Wasn't easy to choose which track to choose from [Unity 4 Utopia](https://inkswel.bandcamp.com/album/unity-4-utopia), his latest album, as the quality of it being such high. I chose here the funkiest to me and easiest to discover his rich universe filled with trippy loops and unimitable groove.**"**

+ ## Jitwam - Keepyourbusinesstoyourself
_ImaCrea_: **"**Chill and relax if you haven't finished yet your coffee...**"**

+ ## Blank Banshee - Ecco Chamber
_ImaCrea_: **"**New year, new beats, new neural connections. Some of the subtlest and most anticipated beat of last year to me, right here to project you into the future.**"**

+ ## Moda - 5 Foot Renegade
_ImaCrea_: **"**2017 is going to be great, but also radical. For that you need full energy, here's your vitamin shot. Enjoy.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks to Inkswel... and happy new year! Enjoy your Sunday!</p>
