  This morning, let’s start things off right, with a healthy dose of aural sugar
  from our guest, Inkswel. Ignore ‘new year, new you’ (because we like you just
  the way you are) and instead, let’s take ‘new year, new grooves’ as our
  mantra.

<p id="introduction">This morning, let’s start things off right, with a healthy dose of aural sugar from our guest, [Inkswel](https://inkswel.bandcamp.com/). Ignore ‘new year, new you’ (because we like you just the way you are) and instead, let’s take ‘new year, new grooves’ as our mantra.</p>

# New grooves

If anything is sure, it's that our vitals need some love before facing the coming year, and Australian funk maestro [Inkswel](https://inkswel.bandcamp.com/) has us covered, with all the musical nutrients necessary to kick start 2017 and get our bodies moving in a way that would make even James Brown proud. So forget who and where and why you are, while we channel this cosmic mix down the copper wires and into your soul. Let the quest for musical utopias continue.

# Inkswel's selection

+ ## Mario & Malice Sweet - Superstar (produced by Tall black guy)
_Inkswel_: **"**Found these guys through TBG soundcloud originally, but have become a huge fan of this couple doing dope music together! this joint is such a sunday morning summer jam and its also produced by TBG so its heat from start to finish! Want to work with these guys so bad! Holla!**"**

+ ## 30/70 Collective- The Strut
_Inkswel_: **"**Melbourne bad ass shit right here! these guys are going to be huge! The next generation of future soul music from aussie shores with a concious blueprint! So much love!**"**

+ ## Selah Sue- I Wont Go For Mine (MNDSGN REMIX)
_Inkswel_: **"**This is just feel good music in its essence. Amazing new talent of up and coming pop talent Selah Sue but paired with one of the dopest producers in the game right now. This really shows that when a vocalist gets paired with a dope producer it brings out the best in their work! Vibes!**"**

# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Inkswel - Together (feat. Colonel Red)
_ImaCrea_: **"**Wasn't easy to choose which track to choose from [Unity 4 Utopia](https://inkswel.bandcamp.com/album/unity-4-utopia), his latest album, as the quality of it being such high. I chose here the funkiest to me and easiest to discover his rich universe filled with trippy loops and unimitable groove.**"**

+ ## Jitwam - Keepyourbusinesstoyourself
_ImaCrea_: **"**Chill and relax if you haven't finished yet your coffee...**"**

+ ## Blank Banshee - Ecco Chamber
_ImaCrea_: **"**New year, new beats, new neural connections. Some of the subtlest and most anticipated beat of last year to me, right here to project you into the future.**"**

+ ## Moda - 5 Foot Renegade
_ImaCrea_: **"**2017 is going to be great, but also radical. For that you need full energy, here's your vitamin shot. Enjoy.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks to Inkswel... and happy first 2K17 Sunday!</p>
