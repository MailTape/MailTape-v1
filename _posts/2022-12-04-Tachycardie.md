# Tachycardie's selection

## Able Noise - Side A
Tachycardie: **"**I got this record from Alex, who plays drums in this awesome band. He invited me to be part of  his great festival "Onze Ambassade" in The Hague, and I was amazed by all the bands I saw and heard there, so I was quite sure that his band would sound awesome. True fact, it does. A really well balanced combination of vocal melodies, repetitive and simple forms of drums/guitar parts, and a perfect use of tape recorder manipulations, to bring a brilliant lo-fi measure to this wonderfull and coherent record, from start to end.I still don't know when it's best to listen to this band, probably all the time.**"**

## Omnie - Courtesy Call
Tachycardie: **"**Rock essential oil. Nothing to add to these three words. These good poeple know exactly how to write a song. Everything is in its place, making this composition as well structured as a pineau d'aunis wine combined with a nicely refined  goat cheese on a freshely made bread. Everything here is a must, from the sound of the snare, to the choice of melodies, the use of cymbals, the vocals, lyrics, production, album cover...
I'd advise anyone to listen to any of the song this band composed.**"**
