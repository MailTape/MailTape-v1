  This morning, we explore, we dematerialize, we deconstruct the music. We beat
  it to find inspiration, we saturate it to its fullest, we look for the
  unknown, the astonishing, the shocking, the disconcerting in order to touch.
  This is what Tachycardie offers us through this playlist.

<p id="introduction"> This morning, we explore, we dematerialize, we deconstruct the music. We beat it to find inspiration, we saturate it to its fullest, we look for the unknown, the astonishing, the shocking, the disconcerting in order to touch. This is what Tachycardie offers us through this playlist.
<br><br>
Through his EP “[Nouvelles et Anciennes Pratiques de Cartographie Amateure](https://tachycardie1.bandcamp.com/album/nouvelles-et-anciennes-pratiques-de-cartographie-amateure)”, Tachycardie offers us a different experience, a different way of seeing and consuming music. Only you can judge this one because it is an adventure in itself. It’s worth a visit!

# Tachycardie's selection

## [Able Noise](https://ablenoise.bandcamp.com/releases) - Side A
Tachycardie: **"**I got this record from Alex, who plays drums in this awesome band. He invited me to be part of  his great festival "Onze Ambassade" in The Hague, and I was amazed by all the bands I saw and heard there, so I was quite sure that his band would sound awesome. True fact, it does. A really well balanced combination of vocal melodies, repetitive and simple forms of drums/guitar parts, and a perfect use of tape recorder manipulations, to bring a brilliant lo-fi measure to this wonderfull and coherent record, from start to end.I still don't know when it's best to listen to this band, probably all the time.**"**

## [Marina Rosenfeld](https://www.marinarosenfeld.com/) - Fuji Tonic

## [Omni](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/album/networker) - Courtesy Call
Tachycardie: **"**Rock essential oil. Nothing to add to these three words. These good poeple know exactly how to write a song. Everything is in its place, making this composition as well structured as a pineau d'aunis wine combined with a nicely refined  goat cheese on a freshely made bread. Everything here is a must, from the sound of the snare, to the choice of melodies, the use of cymbals, the vocals, lyrics, production, album cover... I'd advise anyone to listen to any of the song this band composed.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Tachycardie](https://tachycardie1.bandcamp.com/) - Pratiques IV & V
Anaïs G: **"**Musical exploration, unstructured sounds, Tachycardie wants us to think about music differently. As a vibratory art using instruments or materials but also in we offer a free vision, another album format under the name of “Nouvelles et Anciennes Pratiques de Cartographie Amateure”, with several pieces proposed as a kind of “cinema for the ears. ” We are going through several emotions at once before we understand the concept of this musician.**"**

## [Chassol](https://chassol.bandcamp.com/) - Pipornithology, Pt.1
Anaïs G: **"**Chassol is one of my must-haves. Whether this pianist is solo or accompanied by other singers such as [Bonnie Banane](https://bonniebanane.bandcamp.com/), he is right in the way he treats music and sound, touching where it is needed, with that subtlety and sensuality, thus leading us into his world. In the album “[Big Sun](https://chassol.bandcamp.com/)” I always had a preference for the title “Bird, Pt.1”, with those sounds of birds, so light, natural and beautiful. But this time by sticking closer to the music offered by Tachycardie I wanted to show a side of him even more offbeat and crazy with the title “Pipornithology, Pt.1.”**"**

##  [Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/) - Potion Trouble
Anaïs G: **"**Distort the music, in order to have a raw look and feel the simplest emotions. It’s kind of what you feel when you listen to this song “Potion Trouble”.Repetitive in the rhythms but at the same time hypnotizing, I also advise you to go listen to his first album released at the end of 2020 with notably the title “[Spiritismes et Nouvelles Technologies](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/track/spiritisme-et-nouvelles-technologies)”.**"**

## [Loya](https://loyamusic.bandcamp.com/) - Zenfant
Anaïs G: **"**To finish this daring playlist, it seemed logical to propose Loya. This native Reunion, offers us a music influenced by his culture by mixing electro with Maloya. “Zenfant”, one of the tracks from the album “[Corail](https://loyamusic.bandcamp.com/album/corail)” transcends us and touches us in the depths of us!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [Tachycardie](https://tachycardie1.bandcamp.com/) these thoughtful Sunday selections, and many thanks to [Julie Wojtczak](https://www.instagram.com/julie_wo/) for this episode's stunning illustration !</p>
