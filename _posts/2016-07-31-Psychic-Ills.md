<p id="introduction">This morning, discover a warm and indie selection made by our guest [Psychic Ills](https://www.facebook.com/psychicills). Packed with love and caring lyrics, this issue is perfect to accompany a little poem of yours for your secret lover or one of your special friends.</p>

# Music, discovery and truth.

What is it that makes a track a “discovery”? By discovery, I’m talking about these special tracks which gets in our memory and therefore changes, slightly or deeply, who we are.

Of course it’s over pretentious to pretend I’d have such answer. What I can humbly say is each track I curated for MailTape triggered in me a strong emotional response.

But there’s more to that. I feel there’s something related to truth. It feels like they’re sweating some answers, something that feels simply true.

A kind of truth which can only come from a creation inspired by love.

# Psychic Ills' selection:

## Kris Kristofferson - Sunday Morning Coming Down
_Psychic Ills_: **"**I love easing into Sundays with some old country favorites, so I figured I would get literal with this choice. I think everyone has spent more than a few Sunday mornings reflecting on the night before and where you are today. Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson also recorded great versions of this song.**"**

## Traveling Wilburys - Handle With Care
_Psychic Ills_: **"**We listened to the Traveling Wilburys a lot on our last tour in June. I mean, has there ever existed a more legendary supergroup? George Harrison takes the lead vocal on this track and when Roy Orbison comes in with the chorus, man, the sound of his voice melts my heart every time. Perfect for Sunday morning or any day.**"**

## Bill Withers - Lovely Day
_Psychic Ills_: **"**Any time you want to start the day out right, put this song on. The laid back groove and classic bass line that opens the song sets the mood, "... it's gonna be a lovely day”**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to Psychic Ills for their selection. We hope you enjoyed this issue! Let us know your thoughts!</p>
