<p id="introduction">This morning, it is FINAL 2021. What can we wish for this year? Health, already the most important one compared to the others but above all the reopening of all its places of culture, music and events. . . And of course full of beautiful things to all those who follow us, hoping to surprise you, amaze you and please you again every Sunday.
<br><br>
For this first Sunday of 2021, I am accompanied by [Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes](https://soundcloud.com/danse-musique-rhone-alpes), to get you out of bed.
</p>


# Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes's selection

## Tachycardie – D'humeur à savoir
DMRA: **"**Tachycardie is (as far as I’m concerned) for music what French ufologist [Jimmy Guieu](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Guieu) is for French Ufology. A Versatile genius and a pathological workaholic. And just as Jimmy Guieu concerning his wardrobe, Jean-Baptiste Geoffroy has a very elegant approach towards life.**"**

## RAIME - Some Things Can Happen, Just Like This
DMRA: **"**A British duet that I discovered by chance, and which EP « am I using content or is content using me » has followed me through as many Sundays as my sober self can remember.This record has a very smooth groove, warm and comforting melodic presence, but is nevertheless digging in a field filled with 3D printed plastic trees. I am not yet very clear about this but it seems the drummer [Valentina Magaletti](https://valentinamagaletti.com/) is involved in this project, which makes it even more interesting, even though I prefer not to know exactly what’s what, and who’s who, and when it occurred.**"**

## [Laurel Halo](https://soundcloud.com/laurelhalo) – Koinos
DMRA: **"**Excerpt from the DUST album, in which Halo collaborates with many different artists. In this track, we can sense Elie Keszler’s ghostly presence, imposing but soft and precise.The two artistic dimensions, Halo’s and Kesler’s, meet in a very nice manner here, making the « experimental pop music experience » possible in a way, and especially on Sundays.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes](https://www.kythibong.org/en/bands/dmra.php) – Spiritisme et nouvelles technologies
Anaïs G: **"**Her name first aroused my curiosity. It's afterwards, listening to his EP "[Shit Forest](https://kythibong.bandcamp.com/album/shit-forest)" released on the [Kythibong](https://www.kythibong.org/) label, that I was drawn into a strange universe between film and video games. Loup Gangloff is a musical UFO all by himself. He was part of the [Deux Boules Vanille](http://2boulesvanille.com/) group before going solo. This "Shit Forest" that he suggests we listen to is simply a reflection of our current society. A nice shit, a cheerful mess, indispensable for your evenings during your next curfew!**"**

## [Tite](https://www.facebook.com/djtite1) – Zhang
Anaïs G: **"**Like a contemporary dance choreography, as we can see in the music video, it’s energetic and unstructured. The contrast between the elegance and beauty of the gestures and this industrial and cold music transports us into a parral world where violence is nothing but sweetness.**"**

## [Maud Geffray](https://soundcloud.com/maudgeffray) – In the Wild 
Anaïs G: **"**Kubrick atmosphere with Maud Geffray. That’s good, because the title “In the wild” that I selected, is taken from the EP-film “[1994](https://soundcloud.com/pan-european-recording/sets/maud-geffray-1994)” A lunar musical jewel, which surpasses anything imaginable, which is worth the detour! **"**

## [Louisahhh](https://soundcloud.com/louisahhh) – Trap
Anaïs G: **"**A certain intensity and power that can be found in Louisahh’s compositions that makes us love his music without forgetting the assumed industrial side. A violent end of selection in order to be well awake this Sunday.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes](https://soundcloud.com/danse-musique-rhone-alpes) for his Sunday selections and to Jason Pridham for this episode's brilliant illustration!</p>
