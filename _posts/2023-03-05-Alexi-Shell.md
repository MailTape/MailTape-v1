<p id="introduction">This morning, we're very excited to have [Alexi Shell](https://alexishell.bandcamp.com/album/sirens) with us. Her selection full of positive vibes and raw energy is simply perfect to start the new month. Spring is coming, let's dance to welcome the 23rd spring of the millennium! And for our friends who live on the other side of the planet, this will make a great one to keep the summer going on solid. With much love.</p>

# Alexi Shell's selection

## [Caroline Polachek](https://carolinepolachek.bandcamp.com/album/desire-i-want-to-turn-into-you) - Welcome to my island

Alexi Shell: **"**I'm an absolute fan of Caroline Polachek and her new album. I am so impressed and haunted by her voice, but also by the way she tends to a mainstream pop staying at the same time in a super alternative way with her voice treatment and all the production and the artists with who she's working.**"**


## [Egregore](https://egregore.bandcamp.com/) - Birth of a Cyber Goddess

Alexi Shell: **"**We discovered this amazing track while working on my Album with S Diamah. Since then, I've really listened to it on repeat for weeks and weeks, I find the construction so good, and the melody and the voices are sooo emotional! This is exactly what I am looking for in trance music! Fun fact: Some days after I discovered this song, I followed Egregore on Soundcloud, and he wrote to me to exchange our tracks. So I jumped on the occasion to ask him if he would like to produce a remix for my album, and guess what? The remix will be out on 03.31! Stay tuned ;)**"**

## [Malibu](https://mmmmalibu.bandcamp.com/album/one-life-2) - Lost at Sea

Alexi Shell: **"**I remembered listening to this song on a ferry in Greece in may 2021, watching the sea whip up the boat, wondering what was inside this dark blue water. These kinds of moments and music are so inspiring for me, it helps me to think and to create stories and music. I was in fine art school with Malibu and I am so glad now to listen to her music really often! Full support !**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Alexi Shell](https://alexishell.bandcamp.com/album/sirens) - Eruption

ImaCrea: **"**Alexi's album is so eclectic, it was hard to decide which track to choose. Oscillating from ambient to techno, I wanted to find the right balance with the global energy of the episode and I believe we've got it here. Progressive energy building up, I listen to it and I envision a portal toward deep positive personal transformation. Spring is coming and this track is here as a reminder. Prepare for your metamorphosis.**"**

## [Bambii](https://bambiibambii.bandcamp.com/track/ride-with-me) - Ride With Me

ImaCrea: **"**Right, let's keep it flowing with Bambii... Challenging all music borders, her production is inspired by her Jamaican roots she crushes together with breakbeat, d&b, club, and jungle vibes.**"**

## [Kelela](https://kelela.bandcamp.com/album/raven) - Bruises

ImaCrea: **"**The queen Kelela is back with her new album, Raven, already an acclaimed masterpiece. Produced with some of the most exciting talents around LSDXOXO, Bambii... Spring is going to be insane!**"**


## [DJ Python](https://worldwideunlimited.bandcamp.com/album/esplit-ep) - I'm Tired

ImaCrea: **"**You've been dancing all night, a new day starts... You're sweaty and everybody is exhausted, in a good way. All toxins from your body are left away, you feel rejuvenated and the sun is rising. And now, this track. Full bass on.**"**

<p id="outroduction">Thatâ€™s it for this Sunday morning! Thanks for being with us. Put the volume up, and dance with your neighbors. Much love to [Alexi Shell](https://alexishell.bandcamp.com/album/sirens) for her ecstatic selection which gave me great joy to make my selection. Also, big "bravo" to Meriam for this stunning illustration and her work which keeps surprising me amazingly. So much beauty here.</p>
