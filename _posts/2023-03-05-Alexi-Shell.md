# Alexi Shell's selection

## Caroline Polachek - Welcome to my island

Alexi Shell: **"**I'm an absolute fan of Caroline Polachek and her new album. I am so impressed and haunted by her voice, but also by the way she tend to a mainstream pop staying at the same time in a super alternative way with her voice treatment and all the production and the artists with who she's working.**"**


## Egregore - Birth of a Cyber Goddess

Alexi Shell: **"**We discovered this amazing track while working on my Album with S Diamah. Since then, I've really listened to it in loop for weeks and weeks, i find the construction so good, and the melody, the voices are sooo emotional ! This is exactly what I am looking for in trance music ! Fun fact : Some days after I discovered this song, I followed Egregore on Soundcloud, and he wrote to me to exchange our tracks. So I jumped on the occasion to ask him if he would like to produce a remix in my album, and guess what ? The remix will be out on 03.31 ! Stay tuned ;)**"**

## Lost at Sea - Malibu

Alexi Shell: **"**I remembered listening this song on a ferry in greece in may 2021, watching the sea whip up the boat, wondering what's inside this dark blue water. This kind of moments and musics are so inspiring for me, it helps me to think and to creates stories and music. I was in fine art school with Malibu and i am so glad now to listen to her music really often ! Full support !**"**
