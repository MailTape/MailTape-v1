<p id="introduction">We're extremely happy to welcome
[S8FJOU](https://www.s8jfou.com/) (a.k.a. "suis-je fou ?", in French, to
translate as "am I mad?" in English) for today's Mailtape episode! Born in the
90's in France and living somewhere between the city, an hidden off-the-grid
cabin in the Pyrénées mountains, and a small handmade boat, S8JFOU, or
Billy, has centered is life around exploring music.<br /><br />What is striking
with S8JFOU is how much his approach to music is that of a craftsman. Always on
the edge of experimental Ambient and IDM, he composes with his own custom-made
synths. He now also deep dives into numerical music, creating his own Ableton
and MaxMSP softwares.<br /><br />Take your seat, we're about to embark in a both
atmospheric and futuristic journey!</p>

# S8JFOU's selection

## [Soup](https://detund.bandcamp.com/track/memorycore) - Memorycore

S8JFOU: **"**An impossible mix between deep emotions, softness, and extreme
digital bug. I am really touched by this track and the freedom it carries with
it, which made me discover other ways of electronic music.


## [User18081971](https://soundcloud.com/user18081971/qu-1) - Qu1

S8JFOU: **"**One of the most beautiful ambient tracks I've listened to so far,
given by an illustrious musician of our time (Aphex Twin, editor's note) under
another pseudonym, in memory of his father who died that year.**"**

## [Rob Clouth](https://robclouth.bandcamp.com/track/a-shiver-sequence) - A Shiver Sequence

S8JFOU: **"**Huge research of distorted and reverberated electro-acoustic
textures in a beautiful melancholic atmosphere. A very nice way to make
electronic music with audio recordings. This track and the album on which it is
present takes me very far into other worlds.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [S8JFOU](https://s8jfou.bandcamp.com/track/influences) - Influences

Guillaume: **"**S8JFOU's latest album, Op.Echo, does not take its name from
nothing. Composed with only two Ableton plugins, Operator and Echo, it
paradoxically embarks us for an extraordinary rich and textured adventure.
Peaceful and floating tracks alternate with more dark and broken stories. How is
S8JFOU able to do that with just two Ableton plugins? Real magic, we may say.

The wonderful piece "Influences", track 2 of the album, shows how tortured
S8JFOU's music can feel. Just the right balance between the soaring atmosphere
of the Ambient pads and the texture of the strong IDM/breakbeat vibe on
top.**"**

## [Squarepusher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4UGYSs56MM) - Tundra 4

Guillaume: **"**Speaking of IDM, here is a track from Squarepusher, one of the
fathers of the genre. With "Tundra 4", we're not too far from what a perfect
opera piece should look like when composed with electronic music in mind.
The 13 minutes of this striking mix of IDM, Breakbeat and Ambient will certainly
move you to somewhere else.**"**

## [Emperors New Clothes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJrjHJSJci0) - Darklight

Guillaume: **"**Let's take a step back to breath a little after those crushing
emotions. With Emperors New Clothes, a mega-band of 10 people, we're up to a
rare mix of Jazz, Folk music and Ambient with "Darkligh" from their Wisdom And
Lies album from 1995. The track leaves us with is this peaceful feeling
sprinkled with just enough of mysterious vibes.**"**

## [Saycet](https://saycet-music.bandcamp.com/track/mother-s8jfou-remix) - Mother (S8JFOU Remix)

Guillaume: **"**Last but not least, a remix of "Mother" from Saycet by our guest
today. If you read the few articles you can find about S8JFOU over the
internets, you will discover that Saycet is part of the reasons Billy chose the
music path in his life. It was Saycet's album One Day At Home After that made
him discovered this very niche kind of music: this mix of melancholia and
texture that we now find in everywhere in S8JFOU's productions**"** 

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for this Sunday morning! We hoped you travelled
far with today's selection, up to some distant planets or spaceships around.
Many thanks to [S8FJOU](https://www.s8jfou.com/) for his selection and [Meriam
