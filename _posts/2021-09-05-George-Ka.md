<p id="introduction">This morning, xxx</p>

# George Ka's selection

## REM - Computer Communication
George Ka:**"**You're back from a hefty night out, haven't slept yet, heart beating heavily, the city is waking up as you head to your place**"**

## Hak Baker - Venezuela Riddim 
George Ka:**"**You are a green plants person, you own many green plants and you know green plants stuff. I don't, but I guess if I did, I'd take care of them on a Sunday morning listening to this.**"**

## Lagrace - Silly
George Ka:**"**You woke up feeling yourself, coffee is dripping, you're fixing some mean sunny side up eggs, and you wine, wine, wine down to the kitchen floor.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## George Ka -  Garçon Manqué Fille Manquante 
ImaCrea: **"**That wasn't an easy task to select only one track from George Ka's album [*Par Avance*](https://soundcloud.com/heygeorge/sets/par-avance-ep)... Each track is an arrow in the heart. Well there's *Saigon* but we already featured it in our [358th episode with Aryan as guest](https://www.mailta.pe/385/aryane). And then I discovered *Garçon Mangé Fille Manquante*. A deeply courageous song which made me shed a tear first time I listened to it. For a second listen, I recommend watching the video she co-directed with Clotilde Duong Van Huyen, [a beautiful ode to roller derby's famous crew La Boucherie de Paris..](https://invidious.fdn.fr/watch?v=kWl6cuOP2w0)**"**

## Suzanne Belaubre - Campagne
ImaCrea: **"**Introspective track filled with cosmic vibes and sincere lyrics. *"Vivre libre et vivre nue, ouvrir le silence de musique jamais entendue..."* Amen.**"**

## Dry Cleaning - More Big Birds
ImaCrea: **"**xx**"**

## Japanese Breakfast - Posing in Bondage
ImaCrea: **"**xx**"** 

<p id="outroduction"> That's all for this morning! xx</p>
