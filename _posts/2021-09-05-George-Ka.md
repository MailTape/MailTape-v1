<p id="introduction">This morning, xxx</p>

# George Ka's selection

## REM - Computer Communication
George Ka:**"**You're back from a hefty night out, haven't slept yet, heart beating heavily, the city is waking up as you head to your place**"**

## Hak Baker - Venezuela Riddim 
George Ka:**"**You are a green plants person, you own many green plants and you know green plants stuff. I don't, but I guess if I did, I'd take care of them on a Sunday morning listening to this.**"**

## Lagrace - Silly
George Ka:**"**You woke up feeling yourself, coffee is dripping, you're fixing some mean sunny side up eggs, and you wine, wine, wine down to the kitchen floor.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [George Ka](https://soundcloud.com/heygeorge) -  Garçon Manqué Fille Manquante 
ImaCrea: **"**That wasn't an easy task to select only one track from George Ka's album [*Par Avance*](https://soundcloud.com/heygeorge/sets/par-avance-ep)... Each track is an arrow in the heart. Well there's *Saigon* but we already featured it in our [358th episode with Aryan as guest](https://www.mailta.pe/385/aryane). And then I discovered *Garçon Mangé Fille Manquante*. A deeply courageous song which made me shed a tear first time I listened to it. For a second listen, I recommend watching the video she co-directed with Clotilde Duong Van Huyen, [a beautiful ode to roller derby's famous crew La Boucherie de Paris..](https://invidious.fdn.fr/watch?v=kWl6cuOP2w0)**"**

## [Suzanne Belaubre](https://souterraine.biz/album/diy) - Campagne
ImaCrea: **"**Introspective track filled with cosmic vibes and sincere lyrics. *"Vivre libre et vivre nue, ouvrir le silence de musique jamais entendue..."* Amen. Thrilling poetry pushing oneself to live fully with urgency.**"**

## [Dry Cleaning](https://drycleaningband.com/) - More Big Birds
ImaCrea: **"**That drum... It's almost singing. Listen closely. Oh.. I missed such warm vibe, been listening too much to electro lately.**"**

## Japanese Breakfast - Posing in Bondage
ImaCrea: **"**September, a new season starting. Also a new year for some with Rosh Hashana tomorrow. This track inspires me the perfect balanced vibe for such moment. Mind dreaming for wild inspiration while body being fully grounded. Remind me of what I read on a tshirt friday's night at [WarriorRecords](https://www.warriorecords.com/) party... *"Things change, explore your future"*.**"** 

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thanks for being with us as we start this new season! Much love to [George Ka](https://soundcloud.com/heygeorge) for sharing her great energy with this beautiful selection. And thank you Celestin for starting the season with me by releasing such a stunning illustration!</p>
