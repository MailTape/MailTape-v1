<p id="introduction">This morning, let's have a glimpse of today's music and Max Future. It's maybe with artists like Max future that french pop will jump over the next step. With producers like him that country borders in music will definetly disappear. Surfing around electronic french Touch, naive sun-pop, or even hip-hop (just listen his selection below), the quality of his EP is very rare for a first shot.

Behind Max Future this is Max Zikkel, and before Max Future, there were Concorde, one of those precursor french pop bands where Max gains the experience he needed to became a great singer/producer. I invite you to look at the clip made for "[Till You Let Go](https://youtu.be/honQKnJ_1Ao)", as inspiring as meditative, and with a stunning aesthetic. </p>

# **Max Future’s selection**

+ ## M.E.D. - Cant Hold On
_Max_: **"**I love this track, the rythym is so loud and the piano's sample so soft. When the bassline is coming, it's totally impossible to not shaking your head to the roof from the ground! **"**

+ ## Tame impala - Prototype (Outkast cover) 
_Max_: **"**For me it's a perfect exemple of a good cover. I usually prefer when the cover get away from the original but here, I found that Tame Impala grab this Outkast's track in a very sensitive way, but keep the original mood of it.**"**

+ ## Joakim - Nothing Gold
_Max_: **"**With "Nothing Gold" Joakim please all 70s or 80s funk's diggers. It's the kind of track wich I love listen in repeat, dissecting every synth sounds and all those small intents for analog producing lovers.  **"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Max Future - Till you Let Go
_Maxime_: **"** A low beat envelop a very high voice during synthes evaporate from Le Havre harbor. This track raise up like lovers who have just met.   **"** 

+ ## JuJu Rogers & Bluestaeb - Get Lost Feat. Regis Molina
_Maxime_: **"** JuJu Rogers and Bluestaeb are back in da house with there smooth and brisk hip-hop. From Germany with flow, they deliver perfect vibe for this sunday. Let's Get Lost guys. **"**

+ ## Buttering Trio - From The Tree
_Maxime_: **"** I follow them since long time and didn't get the success they deserve, at all. It can"t be like this anymore. From Tel Aviv, Butturing Trio make the most classy and original dub I've heard since longtime. [Two crazy producers behind a saxophonist/singer frontgirl](https://youtu.be/HsfzMudFWHA) is the recipe. **"**

+ ## Ryder The Eagle - It's All About The Music
_Maxime_: **"**This track is all about [temporality](https://youtu.be/D9-R2RDXRWo). Its construction has pushed me. There is a concrete beggining, there is an end, OK. But there isn't a middle, and you're constantly waiting for the drop who gonna bring you to the heart of the song. But there isn't and at the end, you just realize that you've loved it !  **"**
