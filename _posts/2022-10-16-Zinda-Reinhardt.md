<p id="introduction">This morning, we're thrilled to be back for this 11th season of music discoveries! The world has greatly changed in these 11 years. More polarized than ever and facing critical issues, we believe music is essential to a world deeply in need of human bonding and love. It's a universal language speaking to our shared consciousness and then translated through our body as dance, and movement.
<br><br>
	And for this 501st episode, we're honored to welcome [Zinda Reinhardt](https://zindareinhardt.bandcamp.com). With her powerful and contagious energy, she sings in Sintikès and activates a language rarely heard. Mixing vibration from trap music with Romani culture, she's courageously opening a new door in the musicscape.

# Zinda Reinhardt's selection

## Lena Platonos - Bloody Shadows From Afar
Zinda Reinhardt: **"**This voice, this Greek mother tongue, this sensual minimalism speaks to me a lot... A Pioneer of electronic music, she uses deep and heavy synthesizers in this piece, completely out of step with her time, she pierces with her interpretation a whole poetic and erotic landscape.
I like everything about her for a while but it remains so current for me, I will have only one word... timeless.**"**

## Bob Vylan - Wicked And Bad
Zinda Reinhardt: **"**English trash as I like it, musical, rhythmic, tackling the social and political problems of British life. A mix of Jamaican dance-hall that makes you dance like a madwoman wherever you are, and the violence of their flow that comes close to dark rock, a return to the rage against the machine that gives you strength and power to say "fuck" to everything that breaks you.**"**

## Lido Pimienta - Para Transcribir
Zinda Reinhardt: **"**Recent and surprising discovery, in the incredible unique voice genre, she is amazing. She is a kind of warrior poetess with engaging texts, who succeeded in combining electro with Colombian trad music with finesse. I find myself very much in her musical work and the emotion that emerges from it. She makes the hairs stand up and sometimes shed a few tears. It feels so good!**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Zinda Reinhardt - Cut Up
ImaCrea: **"**I remember I discovered Zinda Reinhardt's music in Mathilde Fernandez's curation for [episode 451](/451/Mathilde-Fernandez/). I used to listen to *Troumli* on repeat back then. *"Cut up"* is her latest track, just released now for the first time on MailTape (!). And what a banger. More incisive than ever, I don't understand Sintikès but the energy flowing in this track is highly contagious and greatly emancipating.**"**

## Minimi Deutsch - Still Foggy
ImaCrea: **"**Coffee's ready? Or do you prefer a tea? Seat down and listen carefully as Minimi Deutsch shares with us a lesson about krautrock. All previous tracks feature beautiful performers and their deep lyrics, I put this minimal one here as an invitation to let them sink for a moment...**"**

## Mykki Blanco - French Lessons (ft. Kelsey Lu)
ImaCrea: **"**Mykki Blanco... It's been a good couple of years since I hadn't listened to them and wow. What a sweet surprise to discover they just released a new album, "Stay Close to Music", which includes this instant crush. The combination of Mykki Blanco's voice with Kelsey Lu's is pure ecstasy.**"**

## Sudan Archives - Home Maker
ImaCrea: **"**Powerful energy here from talented Sudan Archives, exactly what's needed in these times. The production on this track is quite insane, it feels like one listens to 4 or 5 songs.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for the 501st episode of MailTape! We're glad to be back with a new season of delightful music discoveries. Our thanks to [Zinda Reinhardt](https://zindareinhardt.bandcamp.com) for this Sunday selection and to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for her magnifique illustration!</p>
