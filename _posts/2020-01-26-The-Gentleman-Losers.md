<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome brothers Samu and Ville Kuukka from Helsinki, who have been making music together as [The Gentleman Losers](https://www.gentlemanlosers.com/) since their early teens.
<br><br>
Samu and Ville encapsulate a universe of quiet musical aspirations in a breezy, effortless way. Painting vivid sonic pictures by coaxing dusty guitars, brushed drums and archive documentary music into a blissful daydream, they manage to distil their sound into a pithy pastoral hymn.
<br><br></p>

# The Gentleman Losers' selection

## Amanda Bergman – Questions
_The Gentleman Losers_: **"**[Amanda](https://www.instagram.com/bergmanama/)’s voice has the sense of melancholy sadness and longing that we’re always drawn to. It has that “Scandinavian pain”. This is the best cure for your Sunday morning headaches.**"**

## Discovery Zone – Fall Apart
_The Gentleman Losers_: **"**Discovery Zone is the space cocktail of JJ Weihl of Fenster fame. As the song implies you sometimes have to let yourself fall apart in order to find out who you are. I guess this has been going on with us too. JJ’s music and visuals have a fresh perspective. Reminder for all not get stuck to one’s old habits.**"**

## El Perro Del Mar – Change of Heart
_The Gentleman Losers_: **"**[EPDM](http://www.elperrodelmar.com/) has early on been a big inspiration to us. Quite frankly I think this is the best pop song ever written.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## The Gentleman Losers – Always Crashing on the Same Wave
_Sanjay_: **"**Recorded at [The Vortex](http://www.vortexjazz.co.uk/) in London for the LIAF festival, this is a wonderfully haunting piece. Interweaving, simultaneously reverent and intelligently informed, it bears many characteristics of [Fran & Flora](https://www.franandflora.com/)'s output: otherworldly and unfussy with a cool charm. A fitting accompaniment to early evenings.**"**

## Tunes of Negation – Tundra Erotic
_Sanjay_: **"**[William Parker](https://www.williamparker.net/) began his musical career in the early 70s playing with Don Cherry and Cecil Taylor among many others. In this dedication to Don Cherry he plays one of the late trumpeter's side instruments, the dousn'gouni, an African guitar, accompanied by his vocalising over the top. Recorded at [Somewhere There](http://somewherethere.org/) in Toronto this track, alongside 'For Ella Parker', act as effective leavening agents to the uncompromising intensity and energy of the 50-minute title track, 'Cathedral Wisdom Light'—perfectly expressed by the artwork of the album.**"**

## Yama Warashi – Quagmire Moon
_Sanjay_: **"**[Tomeka Reid](https://www.tomekareid.net/) is one of my favourite cellists around today. Her compositions involve intriguingly complex textures while leaving ample room for individual expression and adventure. I love the abstract and atmospheric sound of this track, and I can't wait to listen to the new record from her quartet, [Old New](https://cuneiformrecords.bandcamp.com/album/old-new).**"**

## WaqWaq Kingdom – Koko Says
_Sanjay_: **"**Taken from the Urdu word for 'jungle', this is the title track from sarod-player [Soumik Datta](https://www.soumikdatta.com/)'s latest EP, [Jangal](https://www.soumikdatta.com/music/jangal). Resting somewhere roughly between a mellifluous sonic dance and lament, this track contains the tension and release felt throughout the EP, crescendoing into grievous rage as it progresses.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to [The Gentleman Losers](https://www.gentlemanlosers.com/) for their Sunday selections, and to one of our newest illustrators [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr/) for his brilliant illustration!</p>
