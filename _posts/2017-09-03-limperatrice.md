<p id="introduction">This morning, the glitter balls are spinning a little slower and our limbs swaying more gently in the dark. L'Impératrice is here to help us close out the summer, in the soft shadows of a long expected sunrise. As a glowing haze settles and the lights come up, this disco is slipping into slow motion, a living nostalgia for the endless poolside midnights.</p>
<p>Allowing us to dance and feel, L'Impératrice make our transition through this gauzy existence as effortless as floating across water, with their elegant brand of hypnotic, cinematic funk. Thanks to this gently pulsing energy, we can keep moving until we are the last of the dispersing crowd, neon-lit reflections forever dancing in our eyes.</p> 


# L'Impératrice's selection


## 113 - Les Princes de la ville

## Françoise Hardy- Juke-box

## Pépite - Sensation


# MailTape's selection

## L'Impératrice — Agitations Tropicales
_M_: **"** _"Agitations tropicales"_ is the hit from L'Impératrice. It poses their funk claims in a country unaccustomed to these sounds. A multicolored stone into a pond asleep. This track is the hymn of an imaginary planet covered with tropical jungle on which daft punk had to reign years ago. It is now an empire without frontiers that has found its empress. **"**

## Cornelius- If you're here
_M_: **"** Iconic Japanese producer, Cornelius give us a sweet and bitter melody with an hypnotic slowness. _"If You're Here"_ is a piece of exploring music, which cradles our lazy imagination. **"**

## Haruomi Hosono & Friends - The Last Paradise
_M_: **"** Haruomi Hosono is one of the magicians from The Yellow Magic Ochestra, cultissim and luxurious japanese funk band. His solo career is as messy as his past band, but it allway gives birth to little wonders. _"The Last Paradise"_ is a condensed of Polynesia recorded in a tokyoite basement. Perfect for the end of summer.**"**

## Steve Monite - Only You (Frankie Francis Disco Jam edit)
_M_: **"** 30 years ago, Nigerian funk should have rules dancefloors all around the world. Steve Monite and Bibi Mascel should have be next to the king of pop. Out in 1984, _"Only you"_ is an timeless diamond that Frankie Francis [(Sofrito)](http://www.sofrito.co.uk/) has polished without loosing it devastating groove.**"**
