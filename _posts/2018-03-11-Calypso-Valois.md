<p id="introduction">This morning in our new episode, we enter into the world of movies. And to guide us in our journey, I'm delighted to have [Calypso Valois](https://www.facebook.com/calypsovalois/ "Calypso Valois's Facebook page") as our guest. Calypso Valois seems to be one of those timeless artists. Elli And Jacno's daughter, Etienne Daho's goddaughter, she naturally follows the lead of her elders, and continues their mission to magnify the French language.</p>


# Calypso Valois's selection


## Chopin — Etude po. 25 n. 11 ‘Le Vent d’Hiver’
_Calypso Valois_: **"**It is one of my favorite song, it makes me feel like I’m in a vicious but fantastic whirlwind. It is really interesting how the main melody is played with the left hand, whereas the right hand develops a « swirling » chromaticism.**"**

## Karl Heinz Schäfer — Exterieur, Exterieur Nuit (ost)
_Calypso Valois_: **"**I love soundtracks from 60s/70s/80s movies. After classical music, this is what I listen to the most. Listening to it on Sundays brings me into a particular state. It is such a pleasant feeling to watch a movie with your ears.**"**

## The Bee Gees — You Should Be Dancing
_Calypso Valois_: **"**That song always gives me so much energy. It even encourages me when it comes to household tasks.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Calypso Valois — Le Jour
_Manon_: **"**The energy, the rage spread by the rhythm of this track is welcomed to start a Sunday morning with a conquering spirit. For me, it already sounds like a classic. I distinguish a touch of Gainsbourg in the instrumental part, and elegance in the style of Francoise Hardy in the voice.**"**

## Khruangbin — Cómo Me Quieres
_Manon_: **"**This intrumental piece of art composed by this Texan genius could completely be the soundtrack from a movie of the last century.
The haunting melody of the electric guitar evoques me the beauty and the freedom of movies like _Easy Rider_, mixed with a bit of deepness and melancholia.**"**

## Petula Clark — La Nuit N'en Finit Plus
_Manon_: **"**Because lonely Sundays also need their anthem.**"**

## Soft Cell — Say Hello Wave Goodbye
_Manon_: **"**Sounding like an ending theme, this song is perfect to end our adventures.**"**
