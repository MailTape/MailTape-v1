<p id="introduction"> This morning we are pleased to welcome saxophonist and composer, [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com), to select three church-inspired Sunday morning tunes with us.
<br><br>
James Brandon Lewis articulates a big sound and deftly reconciles the worlds of the spiritual and the cerebral. But there isn't an easy shorthand for his musical approach. Ever since his early releases—_Moments_, _Divine Travels_—the New York-based saxophonist has balanced a deep, gospel-informed spirituality with free jazz abandon.

# Camilla George's selection

##  Kenny Garrett – Charlie Brown Goes to South Africa
_Camilla George_: **"**I am a huge [Kenny](http://www.kennygarrett.com/) fan and love his playing as much as his compositions. This is one of the first tunes of his that I heard and I have been hooked ever since!**"**

## Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins & Sonny Stitt – On the Sunny Side of the Street
_Camilla George_: **"**I love both [Sonny Rollins](https://sonnyrollins.com/) and [Sonny Stitt](https://www.sonnystitt.com/)’s playing on this as well as Dizzy’s singing at the end!**"**

## Zara McFarlane – Silhouette
_Camilla George_: **"**I have worked with [Zara](https://www.zaramcfarlane.com/) a lot over the years and she is one of my favourite artists. I love this tune in particular from her new album 'Arise'. Its melody is beautifully haunting.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Camilla George – Polkadots And Moonbeams
_Sanjay_: **"**Taken from [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com)'s 'Divine Travels' album, we hear James unafraid to play in a spiritual manner on this track. His lines sway with fervour, mixing the blues shouts with shouts of 'hallelujah' alongside poet [Thomas Sayers Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sayers_Ellis) who reads with the trio.**"**

## Nicholas Payton – #BAMboula
_Sanjay_: **"**In remembrance of a love lost, 'Najwa' revisits, in a way, [Wadada Leo Smith](https://wadadaleosmith.com/)'s earliest influences with a guitar album of sorts. As such, the album celebrates past masters of creative music: Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Ronald Shannon Jackson and Billie Holiday. It features four guitarists—[Michael Gregory Jackson](http://michaelgregoryjackson.com/), [Henry Kaiser](http://www.henrykaiserguitar.com/), [Brandon Ross](https://www.brandonross.nyc) and Lamar Smith—who paint translucent colours over odd, muscular bass, drums and percussion grooves performed by [Bill Laswell](https://billlaswell.bandcamp.com/), [Pheeroan akLaff](https://www.pheeroanaklaff.com/) and [Adam Rudolph](https://metarecords.com/adam.html), respectively. Celestial bliss!**"**

## Sarah Tandy – Timelord
_Sanjay_: **"**On her album, 'Impermanence', [Susana Santos Silva](https://susanasantossilva.com/) combines plenty of feints and decoys before unleashing her furious assaults on trumpet. A varied composer who sketches intricate, melodic textures, full of intriguing tension and an expansive interplay, as in this moving ballad.**"**

## Sarathy Korwar & Upaj Collective – Journey in Satchidananda
_Sanjay_: **"**Recorded in one take during an improvised session in Brooklyn, this piece eschews the robustness generally associated with improvisation. The music reveals itself slowly and in a most quiet self-effacing way.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for his stunning illustration.</p>
