<p id="introduction"> This morning we welcome London-based saxophonist and composer, [Camilla George](http://camillageorge.com/), to select three Sunday morning tunes including some of her inspirations and collaborations.
<br><br>
Born in Nigeria, Camilla George studied at Trinity College of Music and emerged from the influential Tomorrow’s Warriors and Jazz Jamaica bands to a Mobo nomination in 2013. Her tutors have included fellow saxophonists Jean Toussaint, Tony Kofi, Julian Siegel, Christian Brewer and Martin Speake.

# Camilla George's selection

##  Kenny Garrett – Charlie Brown Goes to South Africa
_Camilla George_: **"**I am a huge [Kenny](http://www.kennygarrett.com/) fan and love his playing as much as his compositions. This is one of the first tunes of his that I heard and I have been hooked ever since!**"**

## Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins & Sonny Stitt – On the Sunny Side of the Street
_Camilla George_: **"**I love both [Sonny Rollins](https://sonnyrollins.com/) and [Sonny Stitt](https://www.sonnystitt.com/)’s playing on this as well as Dizzy’s singing at the end!**"**

## Zara McFarlane – Silhouette
_Camilla George_: **"**I have worked with [Zara](https://www.zaramcfarlane.com/) a lot over the years and she is one of my favourite artists. I love this tune in particular from her new album 'Arise'. Its melody is beautifully haunting.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Camilla George Quartet – Polkadots And Moonbeams
_Sanjay_: **"**Jimmy Van Heusen’s track is presented in a languid ballad arrangement that features some tender and emotive playing from Camilla's quartet. She is given sympathetic support by the quartet with Camilla herself flowingly lyrical on her own solo. [Daniel Casimir](https://www.danielcasimirbass.com/)’s richly melodic bass feature is a further highlight.**"**

## Nicholas Payton – #BAMboula
  _Sanjay_: **"**Reminiscent of Miles Davis’s Afrocentric early-‘70s experiments, #BAMboula is an easy-paced groove built upon [Nicholas Payton](http://www.nicholaspayton.com/)’s trumpet and Fender Rhodes. Based on the rhythm of the same name (by the renowned [Louis Moreau Gottschalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Moreau_Gottschalk)), it also includes bits of interviews with Dizzy Gillespie and Art Blakey. Nicholas explains #BAM as an acronymic hashtag for Black American Music.**"**

## Sarah Tandy – Timelord
_Sanjay_: **"**A regular at the Servant Jazz Quarters in Dalston, pianist and composer [Sarah Tandy](https://www.sarahtandy.com/) has recently released her debut album, 'Infection in the Sentence'. This track is built around a nifty electronic motif, starting out pretty leisurely before the theme is tentatively explored with some sensitive sax and Zawinul-like sounds.**"**

## Sarathy Korwar & Upaj Collective – Journey in Satchidananda
_Sanjay_: **"**Previous MailTape guest, [Sarathy Korwar](https://www.mailta.pe/249/sarathy-korwar/), follows up his debut album 'Day to Day' with 'My East Is Your West' alongside the Upaj Collective. And it’s a fantastically good one. Alice Coltrane’s harp in the original version is substituted here by a sitar and dulcimer-like santoor—creatinga sweltering, exhausting and intense listen at every turn.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to [Camilla George](http://camillageorge.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for his brilliant illustration.</p>
