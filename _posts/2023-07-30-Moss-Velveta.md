<p id="introduction"> This Sunday, we take the tread into morning's mist as we welcome the elusive [Moss Velveta](https://expensivemusicband.bandcamp.com/) for Episode 533. Presently anonymous, the group's releases strike cinematic intensity, dipping into both baroque dissonances and delicate harmonies at once.</p>

# Moss Velveta's selection

## [Jackson and His Computerband](https://feedingtuberecords.bandcamp.com/album/frame-slip) - Hard Tits
Moss Velveta: **"**Heritage.**"**

## [Lorn](https://solocareer.bandcamp.com/track/renaissance) - Yesterday's Pain
Moss Velveta: **"**Ultra Textured Sonic Landscape.**"**

## [Daniel Hart](https://versis.bandcamp.com/track/la-tierra) - Viventes Enim
Moss Velveta: **"**Humanity Certified.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Moss Velveta](https://expensivemusicband.bandcamp.com/) - Empress
Sarah: **"**From the debut album release, No Basis. The droning synths form their own velvet mist, hovering so carefully over the rhythm and drum section below. The ease in the track's gliding from sustained grooves to momentum hit sections create a soundscape already with a defined narrative.**"**

## [V/Z](https://www.instagram.com/v.z.music/?hl=en), [Valentina Magaletti](https://www.instagram.com/aleeshadibbs/?hl=en-gb), Zongamin - Candles (Version)
Sarah: **"**Produced by V/Z, Valentina Magaletti's drum section and Zongamin's bass weaved together cast the track in such driving intensity, floated but fortified by these celestial vocals.**"**

## [Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith](https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/) - Clover
Sarah: **"**The latest album addition of [Touchtheplants](https://touchtheplants.bandcamp.com/), [Kinetic: Something Concerning Motion](https://touchtheplants.bandcamp.com/album/kinetic-something-concerning-motion). For each album release, a series of experimental artists respond to a thematic prompt. The nature of Kinetic seeks to mend science and sound, the tracks becoming "a collective flow" between the two. A founder of [Touchtheplants](https://touchtheplants.bandcamp.com/), Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith's contribution to the album evokes the neural impulses of plant systems and the vastness of their networks in each intricate synth brush stroke. **"**

## [Caroline Shaw & Attaca Quartet](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtdF0VMpM6j/?hl=en-gb) - The Evergreen: I. Moss
Sarah: **"**This one to finish off our selection, from the group's 2022 album Evergreen. The first of the set of tracks distinguished as The Evergreen (I: Moss; II: Stem; III: Water; IV. Root), the blooms of dissonance crossed by swaying harmonies and soft breathing both disorient and ground us in the moss -- otherworldly.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this week. Thank you for joining us in the mist. Our love to [Moss Velveta](https://expensivemusicband.bandcamp.com/) and our thanks to [Nella Papelita](https://nellapapelita.portfoliobox.net/contact) for this episode's fantastic illustration!</p>
