# Expensive Music Band's selection

## [Jackson and His Computerband](https://feedingtuberecords.bandcamp.com/album/frame-slip) - Hard Tits
Expensive Music Band: **"**This is a collaboration between Gary War and Rob from [Sunburned Hand of the Man](https://sunburnedhandoftheman.bandcamp.com/). For me this is the perfect side A- Sunday morning record. It's how I want to start my day feeling like I have just travelled to hades and back. It's winter here in Australia and cold on the south coast and I usually listen to this after swimming in shark approved waters in the rain. The attention to textures and the way the different movements move in and out of one another fully compliment my halloumi and zucchini frittata or whatever culinary dish I horribly disfigured and forced my family to eat.**"**

## [Lorn](https://solocareer.bandcamp.com/track/renaissance) - Yesterday's Pain
Expensive Music Band: **"**Annabel Blackman is the writer, producer, singer and player of everything on this album. She is the lead axe in the very excellent Body Type and a key collaborator and all round buddy in EMB. She is just one of those ridiculously talented pop savants who should be writing for some pop idol but would rather hustle you for your coin with her pool shark skills. In this song she is calling for a renaissance while a beautiful ostinato flute sound hypnotises you and before you know it a million fragments seep into the song and then the song ends suddenly and you're left lying on the floor in the foetal position because you never wanted the song to end.**"**

## [Daniel Hart](https://versis.bandcamp.com/track/la-tierra) - Viventes Enim
Expensive Music Band: **"**I've listened to this song everyday since its release and it always gets me through life's little challenges. I'm at the stage in my life where my parents are getting a little bit older and I am taking on more responsibility in their care and at the same time I have this beautiful newborn baby that's an amazing gift but also needs a lot of my attention and sometimes you just worry you're not going to be able to keep those plates spinning. This song talks about a young man going through some life adjustments and questions whether or not he will be able to work it out and implores others "to show love in the land" and everytime I get upset about something trivial like being cut off in traffic or someone being hideous to me, I just blast this and know I am gonna get through.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Expensive Music Band](https://expensivemusicband.bandcamp.com/) - Bowling Alone
Sarah: **"**This track arrives from Expensive Music Band's latest album, Things to Say at a BBQ. The lush rhythm section on this one balances the rock-heavier tracks on the rest of the album, with the same playful lyricism as heard on [RNR Cliche](https://expensivemusicband.bandcamp.com/track/rnr-cliche) and [Cool Aunty](https://expensivemusicband.bandcamp.com/track/cool-aunty). The smooth build into Western riffs is so inviting, ideal for our Sunday morning selection :)**"**

## [Aleesha Dibbs](https://www.instagram.com/aleeshadibbs/?hl=en-gb) - Distance
Sarah: **"**Off of Aleesha Dibbs' 2023 solo debut album, Paradise Lost; with this track produced by Tom Crandles. Obsessed with the haunting synths on this track, Aleesha Dibbs' vocals are so smooth and searching.**"**

## [Moonfish](https://moonfish.bandcamp.com/) - Mahi Mahi
Sarah: **"**The joint project of composer-pianist Maria Chiara Argir√≤ and composer-pianist-percussionist Riccardo Chiaberta, Moonfish released this mesmerizing track a couple years back. Love how the synth layers evolve and shift against a rhythm section keeping with the pair's several years on the London jazz scene.**"**

## [Munan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtdF0VMpM6j/?hl=en-gb) - Once Upon a Time
Sarah: **"**A trippy track to finish off our Sunday selection. Entranced by this creative funk distortion :)"**"**
