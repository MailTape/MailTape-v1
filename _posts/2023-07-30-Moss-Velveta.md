## [Aleesha Dibbs](https://www.instagram.com/aleeshadibbs/?hl=en-gb) - Distance
Sarah: **"**Off of Aleesha Dibbs' 2023 solo debut album, Paradise Lost; with this track produced by Tom Crandles. Obsessed with the haunting synths on this track, Aleesha Dibbs' vocals are so smooth and searching.**"**

## [Moonfish](https://moonfish.bandcamp.com/) - Mahi Mahi
Sarah: **"**The joint project of composer-pianist Maria Chiara Argir√≤ and composer-pianist-percussionist Riccardo Chiaberta, Moonfish released this mesmerizing track a couple years back. Love how the synth layers evolve and shift against a rhythm section keeping with the pair's several years on the London jazz scene.**"**
