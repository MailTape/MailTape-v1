<p id="introduction">This morning, we'll take off to the land of clouds. Bring your cookies and magic potion, get on your bike and enjoy the ride, E.T. style. [Aporia](https://aporianz.bandcamp.com/), indie-rock shaman from Aotearoa, will guide us on the beginning of this journey.</p>

# Ujjayi listening

In relation to Yoga, ujjayi breath is sometimes called "the ocean breath". Known as a technique used in Ashtanga, it provides a balancing and calming breath which increases oxygenation and builds internal body heat.

If we could translate this sensation to the act of listening to music, that would be what this playlist has been designed for.

In our age of over-information crushing our minds, it's important to remember the art of music listening. The importance of slowing, and simply enjoying the flow and let our imagination surf on the waves emanating from the speakers.
The same waves which trigger our brain and activate the thalamus, center of sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex, and the regulation of consciousness, sleep, and alertness center. They effect the whole of the brain and therefore can reach as far as influencing our everyday life.

Listen to music, live fully. Namaste.
 

# Aporia's selection:

## Dr. Hooker- Forge Your Own Chains

Aporia: **"**This sounds like a groovier, west coast version of Lou Reed to me. The song is taken from his 1972 album ‘The Truth’ that was recently reissued via Psychedelic Sounds International. Full album is a bit of a mixed bag but this song is great.**"**

## The Durutti Column - Duet 

Aporia: **"**I think Tony Wilson once said that The Durutti Column would never sell but sounded great on a Sunday morning with a spliff! This song is taken from his soundcloud page and was previously known as ‘My Only Love’. All of his material is worth checking out, his guitar playing is beyond belief. I heard recently that Vini Reilly is homeless in Manchester doing it tough so share the love and listen to The Durutti Column.**"**

## Les Rallizes Denudes- White Waking

Aporia: **"**Mythical Japanese psych band that have perhaps the best story in rock n roll. The bass player was involved in the 1970 Yodogo Hijacking and bandleader Takashi Mizutani has forever been shrouded in mystery. No studio recordings, only bootlegs and a lot of feedback! This song is from Mizutani’s more quiet side but still features his signature guitar splatter!**"**

That's all folks, thanks to [Aporia](https://aporianz.bandcamp.com/) for his great and deep selection. Enjoy your Sunday.</p>
