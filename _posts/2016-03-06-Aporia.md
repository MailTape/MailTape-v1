wow some text here

 

# Aporia's selection:

## Dr. Hooker- Forge Your Own Chains

Aporia: 

> This sounds like a groovier, west coast version of Lou Reed to me. The song is taken from his 1972 album ‘The Truth’ that was recently reissued via Psychedelic Sounds International. Full album is a bit of a mixed bag but this song is great.

## The Durutti Column - Duet 

Aporia: **"**I think Tony Wilson once said that The Durutti Column would never sell but sounded great on a Sunday morning with a spliff! This song is taken from his soundcloud page and was previously known as ‘My Only Love’. All of his material is worth checking out, his guitar playing is beyond belief. I heard recently that Vini Reilly is homeless in Manchester doing it tough so share the love and listen to The Durutti Column.**"**

## Les Rallizes Denudes- White Waking

Aporia: **"**Mythical Japanese psych band that have perhaps the best story in rock n roll. The bass player was involved in the 1970 Yodogo Hijacking and bandleader Takashi Mizutani has forever been shrouded in mystery. No studio recordings, only bootlegs and a lot of feedback! This song is from Mizutani’s more quiet side but still features his signature guitar splatter!**"**
