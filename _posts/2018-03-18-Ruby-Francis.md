<p id="introduction">This morning</p>

# Ruby Francis's selection


## Solo Smith — Still in Love
_Ruby Francis_: **"**Randomly found this a few months back, in love with the lo fi production, chord changes and his gorgeous tone.**"**

## Lion Babe — Honey Dew
_Ruby Francis_: **"**I love the colours and textures in this track, it's so spacey and relaxing **"**

## Troy Hudson — Head Over Heels
_Ruby Francis_: **"**I discovered this song when Troy put it out 3 years ago and I'm still obsessed, those harmonies/ backing vocals have me melting.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Ruby Francis — Fall Asleep
_Louise_: **"**The energy, the rage spread by the rhythm of this track is welcomed to start a Sunday morning with a conquering spirit. For me, it already sounds like a classic. I distinguish a touch of Gainsbourg in the instrumental part, and elegance in the style of Francoise Hardy in the voice.**"**

## Still Woozy — Goodie Bag
_Louise_: **"****"**

## WAYI — The Way I Am
_Louise_: **"****"**

## King Princess — Sunburn
_Louise_: **"****"**
