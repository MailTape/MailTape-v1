<p id="introduction">This morning</p>


# Ruby Francis's selection


## Solo Smith
_Ruby Francis_: **"**It is one of my favorite song, it makes me feel like I’m in a vicious but fantastic whirlwind. It is really interesting how the main melody is played with the left hand, whereas the right hand develops a « swirling » chromaticism.**"**

## Karl Heinz Schäfer — Exterieur, Exterieur Nuit (ost)
_Ruby Francis_: **"**I love soundtracks from 60s/70s/80s movies. After classical music, this is what I listen to the most. Listening to it on Sundays brings me into a particular state. It is such a pleasant feeling to watch a movie with your ears.**"**

## The Bee Gees — You Should Be Dancing
_Ruby Francis_: **"**That song always gives me so much energy. It even encourages me when it comes to household tasks.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Ruby Francis — Fall Asleep
_Louise_: **"**The energy, the rage spread by the rhythm of this track is welcomed to start a Sunday morning with a conquering spirit. For me, it already sounds like a classic. I distinguish a touch of Gainsbourg in the instrumental part, and elegance in the style of Francoise Hardy in the voice.**"**

## Khruangbin — Cómo Me Quieres
_Louise_: **"**This intrumental piece of art composed by this Texan genius could completely be the soundtrack from a movie of the last century.
The haunting melody of the electric guitar evoques me the beauty and the freedom of movies like _Easy Rider_, mixed with a bit of deepness and melancholia.**"**

## Petula Clark — La Nuit N'en Finit Plus
_Louise_: **"**Because lonely Sundays also need their anthem.**"**

## Soft Cell — Say Hello Wave Goodbye
_Louise_: **"**Sounding like an ending theme, this song is perfect to end our adventures.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks!

Honey Dew - Lion Babe 

I love the colours and textures in this track, it's so spacey and relaxing

Head Over Heels - Troy Hudson - https://soundcloud.com/iamtroyhudson/head-over-heels

I discovered this song when Troy put it out 3 years ago and I'm still obsessed, those harmonies/ backing vocals have me melting

Still In Love - Solo Smith https://soundcloud.com/solomon-smith-834932779/still-in-love
