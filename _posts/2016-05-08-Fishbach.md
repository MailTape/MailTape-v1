<p id="introduction">This sunday, it’s time to relive some of our memories from the past as well as to create a handful for the future. Our pick of the week, [Fishbach](https://fishbach.bandcamp.com/releases), is all set to do so by engaging you in a playlist that will instantly liven you up.</p>

# Ageless sounds...

It’s almost impossible to resist the pull with which “Mortel” by Fishbach drags you to the era of the 80s or so it seems. The melancholy in it speaks for itself and is easily identifiable; the coldness, however, sets a specific tone that seems to stir a cluster of emotions… Overall, Fishbach flawlessly seems to uphold and deliver the promise of a young budding artist with ageless sounds.   
 
# Fishbach's selection:

## Judah Warsky - Face à l'Ecran
_Fishbach_: "When I’m alone, as a slave in front of the screen, I listen to Judah Warsky sometimes. Then I get in the heart of the machine…"

## Xiu Xiu - Falling
_Fishbach_: "I've discovered Twin Peaks lately. This theme is obsessing me. Perfect to atone for a potential sunday loneliness."

## LENPARROT - Le Carnet à Spirale (William Sheller cover)
_Fishbach_: "It's beautiful when LENPARROT sings. He's a realy stirring boy. Listen to him singing in french, especially a William Sheller's song , it's very classy."

That's all folks, thanks to [Fishbach](https://fishbach.bandcamp.com/releases) for her magical selection.</p>
