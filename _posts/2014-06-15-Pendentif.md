<p id="introduction">
This morning, the Bordeaux-based French pop band [Pendentif](http://www.pendentifmusic.com/ "Pendentif Website") have prepared a musical cocktail to consume irresponsibly. Quietly first, his selection will then energize your morning, be ready...</p>

# From night thoughts to morning inspiration

3 years ago, Pendentif was one of the first bands to blossom out of a new French music scene, having been shaped by their English speaking peers while their lyrics remained attached to a tradition of great French pop classics.
