<p id="introduction">
This morning, the Bordeaux-based French pop band [Pendentif](http://www.pendentifmusic.com/ "Pendentif Website") have prepared for you a freshly musical cocktail to consume irresponsibly...</p>

# French pop lifeblood

Lifeblood of the new wave of pop music that is sweeping France, Pendentif form a nice bridge between the charming English pop and the language of Molière. Their compositions full of intelligence, freshness and charm combine with malice contemporary pop with the tradition of great French classics.

#Their morning selection

## Blood Orange - You're Not Good Enough
_Pendentif:_ **"**This is the song to listen when you get out of the shower, just before joining buddies for a countryside Sunday barbecue.**"**

##Matthewdavid - In My World
_Pendentif:_ **"**Perfect to wake up on Sunday morning when you went to bed at 6am after a good party, in your garden, under the sun, with a cup of coffee. You don’t know if it’s your brain that still spin or if it’s the song.**"**

##Rhye - 3 Days
_Pendentif:_ **"**We chose this title, but this is all the album that you need to listen.
Perfect for a chilling Sunday under the quilt with your love.**"**
