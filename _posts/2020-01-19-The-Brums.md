Bjork - Utopia 
We've been following Bjork since her album "Debut". She's been skin shedding a thousand times since then, always reinventing herself boldly.

Archie Shepp - The Magic of Ju-Ju
Archie Shepp makes music with his guts, his sound feels huge and crushing. This kind of blend between groove and rant is really inspiring for us.

AUTECHRE - y7
AUTECHRE because of their unique way of exploring music.
In "y7", the even and soft beat and the multiple bass' layers show an incredible finess in texture and rhythm.
The musical landscape they build is always coherent, they manage to combine polyrythm, groove and texture with a strong and instantly recognizable artistic signature... it's very impressive.
