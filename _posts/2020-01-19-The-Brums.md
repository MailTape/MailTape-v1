<p id="introduction">This morning, we experiment and mix several things to arrive at an almost perfect musical mess. Our ears are not used to it, so it takes notice of certain sounds while exploring as yet unknown paths. The band The Brums will brighten up our morning to see more clearly.
<br><br>
Coming from Belgium, in Liege, The Brums surprise and amaze with so many colours and mix of styles from jazz to hip-hop. A quator who takes the audience out of its habits to witness a new experience.

# The Brums' selection

## Bjork – Utopia
_The Brums_: **"**We've been following Bjork since her album "Debut". She's been skin shedding a thousand times since then, always reinventing herself boldly.**"**

## Archie Shepp – The Magic of Ju-Ju
_The Brums_: **"**Archie Shepp makes music with his guts, his sound feels huge and crushing. This kind of blend between groove and rant is really inspiring for us.**"**

##  
_The Brums_: **"**Autechre because of their unique way of exploring music.In "y7", the even and soft beat and the multiple bass' layers show an incredible finess in texture and rhythm.The musical landscape they build is always coherent, they manage to combine polyrythm, groove and texture with a strong and instantly recognizable artistic signature...it's very impressive.**"**
