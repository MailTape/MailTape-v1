<p id="introduction">This morning, we experiment and mix several things to arrive at an almost perfect musical mess. Our ears are not used to it, so it takes notice of certain sounds while exploring as yet unknown paths. The band [The Brums](https://thebrums.bandcamp.com/releases) will brighten up our morning to see more clearly.
<br><br>
Coming from Belgium, in Liege, [The Brums](https://www.facebook.com/thebrumsmusic/) surprise and amaze with so many colours and mix of styles from jazz to hip-hop. A quator who takes the audience out of its habits to witness a new experience.

# The Brums' selection

## [Björk](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Björk) – Utopia
_The Brums_: **"**We've been following Björk since her album "[Debut](https://www.bjork.fr/Debut-Album)". She's been skin shedding a thousand times since then, always reinventing herself boldly.**"**

## [Archie Shepp](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Shepp) – The Magic of Ju-Ju
_The Brums_: **"**Archie Shepp makes music with his guts, his sound feels huge and crushing. This kind of blend between groove and rant is really inspiring for us.**"**

##  [Autechre](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autechre) - y7
_The Brums_: **"**Autechre because of their unique way of exploring music. In "y7", the even and soft beat and the multiple bass' layers show an incredible finess in texture and rhythm. The musical landscape they build is always coherent, they manage to combine polyrythm, groove and texture with a strong and instantly recognizable artistic signature...It's very impressive.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## The Brums – Fuzzy
_Anaïs G_: **"**Sometimes symbios is can make it inexplicable. For The Brums it's a bit what I felt when I listened to their EP "[The Brums](https://soundcloud.com/luikrec/sets/the-brums)" released at the end of 2018 by [Luik Music](https://www.facebook.com/luikmusique/). Surprised by so much musicality in this world where everything is the same. Originality, coherence, character for this quator who have not finished to make talk about them!**"**

## [Troublemakers](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troublemakers) – Get Misunderstood
_Anaïs G_: **"**I was listening to the podcasts "[Les Pieds Sur Terre](https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/les-pieds-sur-terre)" a show on France Culture, when I was carried away by the music in the credits. Something disjointed at first glance, with an extract from a dialogue by [Jean-Pierre Leaud](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Léaud) taken from [Philippe Garrel](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Garrel)'s film "[La naissance de l'Amour](http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=8312.html)". A softness like a caress, and incredibly class.**"**

## [Pavane](http://www.pavane-music.com/) – Plumes
_Anaïs G_: **"**I discovered Pavane when they came to Orleans in 2015 for La Tournée Bistrophonique. It was for me a musical love at first sight, something that can't be explained... I remember the emotion I felt when the first notes of the title "[L'échappée](https://soundcloud.com/pavane-music/contreventsetmarees?in=pavane-music/sets/lechappee)" resounded in La Salle de L'Institut. While waiting for a next EP, I hope, here is "Plumes" from their EP "[pppp](https://soundcloud.com/pavane-music/sets/pavane-ep2-pppp)" released in 2016, an organic journey, a breath of fresh air in this world around us.*"**

## [Aphex Twin](https://aphextwin.warp.net/) – IZ-US
_Anaïs G_: **"**Discovered a very short time ago, this Aphex Twin title is gliding, beautiful, subtle... Excerpt from the EP "[Come To Daddy](https://aphextwin.warp.net/release/86695-aphex-twin-come-to-daddy)" this may not be the best of his career but it is perfect for this experimental playlist.**"**
