<p id="introduction">This week we are delighted to welcome London-based electronic musician, [Loraine James](https://soundcloud.com/lorainejames), who selects some groovy Sunday morning chops for us.</p>
<p>Influenced by artists such as Aoki Takamasa, Telefon Tel Aviv and Circa Survive, Loraine crafts organic textures through inorganic means. In her own words, she's making music that is 'sometimes glitch, sometimes ambient—and sometimes in-between electronic music'. Her debut 2017 album, [Detail](https://lorainejames.bandcamp.com/album/detail), is also out now.</p>


# Loraine James's selection


## iLU – It's DOPE!!!
_Loraine James_: **"**I found this song on [Progressive Form's Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/progressive-form), and it's just a nice song with soft vocals that I really like, because I'm so used to hearing them manipulated in some way in this kind of music, haha.**"**

## Yuki Ame – Water From Thoughts
_Loraine James_: **"**My mate sent me this song because they recently supported Shigeto and I knew it was going to be good because he's got a great taste in music. I love the vocal chops with the video game sounding synths, that make it seem playful. I love vocal chops so it was a win for me!**"**

## SASSY 009 – Are You Leaving?
_Loraine James_: **"**I found this group from my 'discover weekly' on Spotify and instantly had their EP on repeat since. If you're a fan of Smerz, you'll love [Sassy009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm1OX0qTB9A).**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Loraine James – Loll (ft. Zarif Miah)
_Sanjay_: **"**I came across Loraine's music when she was performing alongside a friend of mine, Mora, at [London's Splice festival](https://www.richmix.org.uk/events/music/splice-festival-2018-day-1) back in May this year. Loraine was providing the beats and Mora the visuals. I love the attention-to-detail on silence with this track, as well as the ethereal calm and soothing vocals.**"**

## Ouri – Superficial
_Sanjay_: **"**Released on [Make It Rain Records](https://www.justmakeitrain.com/en/) (a sub-label of Montréal-based Bonsound), [Ouri](https://soundcloud.com/ourimusic)'s debut album is more atmospheric than her previous EP, 'Mazes'. This title track feels just right for a Sunday morning: lots of shifting surface textures, elliptical song structures and vocals all sitting comfortably deep in the mix.**"**

## Kilamanzego – stay floated in the tribe.
_Sanjay_: **"**[Angelica Sanchez](http://www.angelicasanchez.com/)'s piano lays out a curious theme in this track. It’s a relaxed, spacious and abstract piece in which the rest of the trio—Tyshawn Sorey and Michael Formanek—play with silence, crafting a kind of meditation. Perfect for a Sunday morning.**"**

## Secret Mommy – Clothing Racks (Sears)
_Sanjay_: **"**I usually take my Sunday morning coffee sat opposite a Pentecostal church in London. The sound of this choir reminds me of those sunny summer mornings complemented by the joyful sound of the gospel choirs inside. See their [live performance of this choral show on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/174609790).**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Loraine James](https://soundcloud.com/lorainejames), and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
