<p id="introduction">This week we are delighted to welcome London-based electronic musician, [Loraine James](https://soundcloud.com/lorainejames), who selects some groovy Sunday morning chops for us.</p>
<p>Influenced by artists such as Aoki Takamasa, Telefon Tel Aviv and Toe, Loraine crafts organic textures through inorganic means. In her own words, she's making music that is 'sometimes glitch, sometimes ambient—and sometimes in-between electronic music'. Her debut 2017 album, [Detail](https://lorainejames.bandcamp.com/album/detail), is also out now.</p>


# Loraine James's selection


## iLU – It's DOPE!!!
_Loraine James_: **"**I found this song on [Progressive Form's Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/progressive-form), and it's just a nice song with soft vocals that I really like, because I'm so used to hearing them manipulated in some way in this kind of music, haha.**"**

## Yuki Ame – Water From Thoughts
_Loraine James_: **"**My mate sent me this song because they recently supported Shigeto and I knew it was going to be good because he's got a great taste in music. I love the vocal chops with the video game sounding synths, that make it seem playful. I love vocal chops so it was a win for me!**"**

## SASSY 009 – Are You Leaving?
_Loraine James_: **"**I found this group from my 'discover weekly' on Spotify and instantly had their EP on repeat since. If you're a fan of Smerz, you'll love [Sassy009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm1OX0qTB9A).**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Loraine James – Loll (ft. Zarif Miah)
_Sanjay_: **"**One of my favourite pianists since listening to her [collaboration with Susana Santos Silva](http://kdsss.tumblr.com/). Kaja's most recent octet blends chorale settings of poetry, composed chamber-like passages and extended improvisation. The lyrics are drawn from the poems of Pablo Neruda, Andriana Minou and Gregor Strnisa with herself on piano, Björk Níelsdóttir and Laura Polence on vocals; Ada Rave and Ab Baars on clarinet and tenor sax; George Dumitriu on violin and viola; Lennart Heyndels on bass; and Onno Govaert on drums and percussion.**"**

## Ouri – Superficial
_Sanjay_: **"**No stranger to MailTape, [Cara Stacey](https://www.mailta.pe/247/cara-stacey/) has recently released '[Ceder](https://kitrecs.bandcamp.com/album/ceder)' with Camilo Ángeles. Recorded in a day of improvisations, Camilo's floaty and impressionistic flute complements Cara’s piano and other instruments.**"**

## Kilamanzego – stay floated in the tribe.
_Sanjay_: **"**[Angelica Sanchez](http://www.angelicasanchez.com/)'s piano lays out a curious theme in this track. It’s a relaxed, spacious and abstract piece in which the rest of the trio—Tyshawn Sorey and Michael Formanek—play with silence, crafting a kind of meditation. Perfect for a Sunday morning.**"**

## Secret Mommy – Clothing Racks (Sears)
_Sanjay_: **"**I usually take my Sunday morning coffee sat opposite a Pentecostal church in London. The sound of this choir reminds me of those sunny summer mornings complemented by the joyful sound of the gospel choirs inside. See their [live performance of this choral show on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/174609790).**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Kaja Draksler](http://kajadraksler.com/), and to [Anaïs Marthe Caura](https://vimeo.com/anaismarthecaura) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
