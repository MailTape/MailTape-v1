  This morning, as I opened my eyes in bed and let my gaze glide across the
  ceiling of my bedroom, it seemed to me that something was missing. Was it a
  little warmth, a few rays of sunshine to pierce the grey winter sky? Was it a
  bit of music to wake up my muscles, or the smell of coffee to get me out of
  bed? In the end, it was a bit of all of the above, everything I love about
  MailTape. So it's with great pleasure that we welcome you back for the first
  episode of this new year. Today, we are thrilled to showcase the distinctive
  talents of the brilliant Brazilian producer, songwriter and
  multi-instrumentalist Diogo Strausz. After releasing music with, among others,
  Razor N'tape and Far Out Records and drawing the attention of Joe Goddard of
  Hot Chip or Gilles Peterson, Diogo released "Flight of Sagittarius", his first
  EP in France, in April 2022 with Goutte d'Or Records. In this episode, prepare
  to be taken on a journey through a kaleidoscopic soundscape, between São
  Paulo, Paris and many other fantastic lands, between retro and neo, always
  with a sunny groove.

# Diogo Strausz's selection

## The Beatles - Here Comes The Sun

Diogo: **"**It's mine and my wife's go-to song to start the day. It just makes us stare at each other and smile, the more we play the more fun it is.**"**

## Robson Jorge & Lincoln Olivetti - Suspira

Diogo: **"**Brazilian Boogie is just the best to start the day. It's sunny, groovy and gives you the energy to do what you gotta do. Great for a full on Sunday, meet friends, take the dog out etc.**"**

## [Alaaska](https://alaaska.bandcamp.com/) - Bangkok

Diogo: **"**This is more for lazy Sundays, just preparing tea and enjoying having nothing to do (if possible).**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Diogo Strausz - Flexível

Jules: **"**‘Flexível’ is [Diogo Strausz](https://diogostrausz.bandcamp.com/)'s last single released in November 2023 on Goutte d'Or Records. He describes this track as his reinterpretation, with a Brazilian twist, of Nigerian music from the 70s, inspired by Afrobeat stars Tony Allen and Fela Kuti. If that doesn't make your mouth water, I don't know what will!**"**

## Nanda Rossi - Livre Pra Voar (Millos Kaiser Edit)

Jules: **"****"**

## Charif Megarbane - Ya Salam

Jules: **"****"**

## Frantz Tuernal - Koultans
