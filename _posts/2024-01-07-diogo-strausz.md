<p id="introduction">
	This morning, we welcome Marseille-based artist and electronic music producer [NxQuantize](https://www.facebook.com/NxQuantize/) to MailTape! After welcoming label boss Goldie B in [episode 537](https://www.mailta.pe/537/goldie-b/), we're delighted to shine the spotlight on another [Omakase Recordings](https://omakaserecordings.bandcamp.com/) artist, who has recently released its dazzling second album <i>OnYi</i>.
<br><br>
As explained by the artist, who coined this neologism, the term 'OnYi' means 'to be in the void', reflecting his exploration of the mysteries of the universe and the limits of our existence. So if, like me, these words make sense when you wake up and your mind is still in a dreamy state, let's not say anymore and get swept up in its rich and contemplative musical universe for a blissful Sunday morning!

# Diogo Strausz's selection

## Beatles - Here Comes The Sun

Diogo Strausz: **"**It's mine and my wife's go-to song to start the day. It just makes us stare at each other and smile, the more we play the more fun it is.**"**

## Lincoln Olivetti and Robson Jorge - Suspira

Diogo Strausz: **"**Brazilian Boogie is just the best to start the day. It's sunny, groove and gives you the energy to do what you gotta do. Great for a full on Sunday, meet friends, take the dog out etc…**"**

## Alaaska - Bangkok

Diogo Strausz: **"**This is more lazy Sundays, just preparing tea and enjoying having nothing to do (if possible)**"**
