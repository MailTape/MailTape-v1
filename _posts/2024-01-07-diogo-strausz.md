  This morning, as I opened my eyes in bed and let my gaze glide across the
  ceiling of my bedroom, it seemed to me that something was missing. Was it a
  little warmth, a few rays of sunshine to pierce the grey winter sky? Was it a
  bit of music to wake up my muscles, or the smell of coffee to get me out of
  bed? In the end, it was a bit of all of the above, everything I love about
  MailTape. So it's with great pleasure that we welcome you back for the first
  episode of this new year. Today, we are thrilled to showcase the distinctive
  talents of the brilliant Brazilian producer, songwriter and
  multi-instrumentalist Diogo Strausz. After releasing music with, among others,
  Razor N'tape and Far Out Records and drawing the attention of Joe Goddard of
  Hot Chip or Gilles Peterson, Diogo released "Flight of Sagittarius", his first
  EP in France, in April 2022 with Goutte d'Or Records. In this episode, prepare
  to be taken on a journey through a kaleidoscopic soundscape, between São
  Paulo, Paris and many other fantastic lands, between retro and neo, always
  with a sunny groove.

Today, we are thrilled to showcase the distinctive talents of the brilliant Brazilian producer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist [Diogo Strausz](https://diogostrausz.bandcamp.com/). After releasing music with, among others, Razor N'tape and Far Out Records and drawing the attention of Joe Goddard of Hot Chip or Gilles Peterson, Diogo released <i>Flight of Sagittarius</i>, his first EP in France, in April 2022 with [Goutte d'Or Records](https://gouttedorrecords.bandcamp.com/). In this episode, prepare to be taken on a journey through a kaleidoscopic soundscape, between São Paulo, Paris, and many other fantastic lands, between retro and neo, always with a sunny groove.

# Diogo Strausz's selection

## The Beatles - Here Comes The Sun

Diogo: **"**It's mine and my wife's go-to song to start the day. It just makes us stare at each other and smile, the more we play the more fun it is.**"**

## Robson Jorge & Lincoln Olivetti - Suspira

Diogo: **"**Brazilian Boogie is just the best to start the day. It's sunny and groovy and gives you the energy to do what you gotta do. Great for a full-on Sunday, meet friends, take the dog out, etc.**"**

## [Alaaska](https://alaaska.bandcamp.com/) - Bangkok

Diogo: **"**This is more for lazy Sundays, just preparing tea and enjoying having nothing to do (if possible).**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Diogo Strausz - Flexível

Jules: **"**‘Flexível’ is [Diogo Strausz](https://diogostrausz.bandcamp.com/)'s last single released in November 2023 on Goutte d'Or Records. He describes this track as his reinterpretation, with a Brazilian twist, of Nigerian music from the '70s, inspired by Afrobeat stars Tony Allen and Fela Kuti. If that doesn't make your mouth water and your ears tingle, I don't know what will!**"**

## Nanda Rossi - Livre Pra Voar (Millos Kaiser Edit)

Jules: **"**This track is taken from the album <i>[Onda De Amor: Synthesized Brazilian Hits That Never Were (1984-94)](https://soundwayrecords.bandcamp.com/album/onda-de-amor-synthesized-brazilian-hits-that-never-were-1984-94)</i>, a treasure trove of synth jams, pop, samba boogie, balearic and electro songs from 1980 & ‘90s Brazil compiled by Millos Kaiser and released on Soundway Records. The title means "Free to fly" and is just perfect for gently continuing our musical journey.**"**

## Charif Megarbane - Ya Salam

Jules: **"**This title from Beirut may seem like an unexpected stopover, did we get lost along the way? Not at all! Like Diogo Strausz, Charif Megarbane is a multi-instrumental producer who builds bridges between different styles and synthesizes many influences from all around the Mediterranean such as Ziad Rahbani, Ahmed Malek, or Issam Hajali. His last album <i>[Marzipan](https://habibifunkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/habibi-funk-023-marzipan)</i> is the first full-length contemporary release of the Habibi Funk label. It reflects the beauty and diversity of Lebanon, between the sometimes chaotic energy of the crowded Beirut metropolis and the warm atmosphere of the Lebanese countryside.**"**

## Frantz Tuernal - Koultans

Jules: **"**The last track of the day is another gem I found in the [Melodies Record Club](https://melodiesinternational.bandcamp.com/album/melodies-record-club-003-hunee-selects) compilation curated by the Korean DJ Hunee. It's a Zouk song with flamenco-inspired guitar playing from Martinique, originally released in 1986 by self-taught guitarist Frantz Tuernal. According to Hunee, it's the perfect sound to look at the sun coming up in the morning, whether you're alone in your room or dancing in front of a DJ booth after a restless night. I'm willing to trust him on this one.**"**
