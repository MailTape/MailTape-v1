# Diogo Strausz's selection

## The Beatles - Here Comes The Sun

Diogo Strausz: **"**It's mine and my wife's go-to song to start the day. It just makes us stare at each other and smile, the more we play the more fun it is.**"**

## Robson Jorge & Lincoln Olivetti - Suspira

Diogo Strausz: **"**Brazilian Boogie is just the best to start the day. It's sunny, groovy and gives you the energy to do what you gotta do. Great for a full on Sunday, meet friends, take the dog out etc.**"**

## Alaaska - Bangkok

Diogo Strausz: **"**This is more for lazy Sundays, just preparing tea and enjoying having nothing to do (if possible).**"**
