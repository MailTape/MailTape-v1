_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**New Age of the New Age by Matthewdavid who runs and records for Leaving Records, best label in the world right now! Mindflight 1 is a perfect track to wake up to the world on a Sunday morning.**"**

+ ## Crystal Voyager OST - Red Sun Sea
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**This label, Anthology Recordings, dug up a bunch of soundtracks from 60's/70's/80's alternative surf movies and all of them are amazing. Here a really cool, laid-back tune from the "Crystal Voyager" OST.**"**

+ ## Spirit Club - Eye Dozer
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**Beach Boys feeling, Papapahooo's, crunchy indie rock guitars...the perfect recipe for me. See also: Jeans Wilder/ Wavves.**"**
