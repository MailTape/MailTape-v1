  This morning, let's all stay in a hazy state thanks to Johnny Hawaii’s trippy
  selection. Johnny Hawaii's psychedelic surf tracks are amazing soundtracks for
  Sundays: long, slow, and dreamy, just what is needed to wrap up the week
  beautifully. So stay still, close your eyes, don't turn on the lights. Take
  this episode as being an excuse to do nothing for some time.

<p id="introduction">This morning, let's all stay in a hazy state thanks to [Johnny Hawaii](https://www.facebook.com/johnnyhawaiiband/ "Facebook")’s trippy selection. Johnny Hawaii's psychedelic surf tracks are amazing soundtracks for Sundays: long, slow, and dreamy, just what is needed to wrap up the week beautifully.</p>
<p>So just stay still, close your eyes, don't turn on the lights. Take this episode as an excuse to do nothing for some time.</p>


# **Johnny Hawaii’s selection**

+ ## Matthewdavid - Mindflight 1
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**New Age of the New Age by Matthewdavid who runs and records for Leaving Records, best label in the world right now! Mindflight 1 is a perfect track to wake up to the world on a Sunday morning.**"**

+ ## Crystal Voyager OST - Red Sun Sea
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**This label, Anthology Recordings, dug up a bunch of soundtracks from 60's/70's/80's alternative surf movies and all of them are amazing. Here is a really cool, laid-back tune from the "Crystal Voyager" OST.**"**

+ ## Spirit Club - Eye Dozer
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**Beach Boys feeling, Papapahooo's, crunchy indie rock guitars...the perfect recipe for me. See also: Jeans Wilder/ Wavves.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Johnny Hawaii - The Parrots Are Not What They Seem (They're Just Pigeons on Acid)
_Inès_: **"**2015. The South of France. Early afternoon. 25°C. Olive trees and flamingos in the background, and Johnny Hawaii playing his set at [This Is Not A Love Song](https://thisisnotalovesong.fr/ "Website") festival. Much like this memory, Johnny Hawaii's songs have this peaceful aura, like a hazy Sunday morning spent doing nothing or taking a nap on a warm afternoon, just because we have the luxury to do so. Pure, unaltered tranquility.**"** 

+ ## The Radio Dept. - It's Personal
_Inès_: **"**Okay so now we're going to a colder country thanks to Swedish The Radio Dept.'s "It's Personal". I have always enjoyed this cold yet dreamy vibe that can be found across their tracks, and this one is one my favorites. Mixing sadness and optimism, it builds up with intensity, feeling overall kind of cathartic. The perfect song to clear your head out to.**"**

+ ## Beach House - Sparks
_Inès_: **"**I have been listening for this song on repeat for the last few weeks. This song has this quiet optimism, making you feel like your in a movie's happy ending (which, to be fair, has its perks in everyday life). So nice.**"**

+ ## The Brian Jonestown Massacre - Viholliseni Maalla
_Inès_: **"**No need to say anything about the Brian Jonestown Massacre, amazing psych band (with the coolest tambourine player). Taken from their album "Aufheben", _Viholliseni Maalla_ feels like a warm blanket, or walking through ethereal clouds, or seeing life through a sepia filter. Very comforting.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [Johnny Hawaii](https://www.facebook.com/johnnyhawaiiband/ "Facebook") for his participation, and Anais for the illustration. Have a lazy Sunday, and enjoy the fact that your weekend won't be over so soon for some of you. </p>
