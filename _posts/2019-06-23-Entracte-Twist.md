# Entracte Twist's selection

##  Cocteau Twins – Head Over Heels
_Entacte Twist_: **"**What we have always listened to. We're big fan of Robin Guthrie's productions, it feel's like it's raining on reverberation. Going through winter in scotland in 1983 seemed to be such a cold and contemplative experience.**"**

## The Homesick – Half Aryan
_Entracte Twist_: **"**Great song from a great band from Netherlands, illustrating how good is the new post punk/ modern garage scene with bands like Women or Omni.**"**
