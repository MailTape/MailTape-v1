<p id="introduction"> This morning, we take out the guitars, adjust our strings test the sound with the amp in boring neighbors...  And let our fingers slide so that we can wake up our faithful on Sunday morning.
<br><br>
New-wave and post punk for your awakening?And why not ... [Entracte Twist](https://www.facebook.com/EntracteTwist/) strays off the beaten track to offer us a selection worthy of the name.

# Entracte Twist's selection

##  [Cocteau Twins](https://www.cocteautwins.com/) – Sugar Hiccup
_Entracte Twist_: **"**What we have always listened to. We're big fan of [Robin Guthrie's](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Guthrie) productions, it feel's like it's raining on reverberation. Going through winter in scotland in 1983 seemed to be such a cold and contemplative experience.**"**

## [The Homesick](https://thehomesick.bandcamp.com/) – Half Aryan!

_Entracte Twist_: **"**Great song from a great band from Netherlands, illustrating how good is the new post punk/ modern garage scene with bands like Women or [Omni](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/).**"**

## [Requin Chagrin](https://www.facebook.com/chagrin.requin/) – Les Plus Mauvaises Nuits
_Entracte Twist_: **"**A traumatical cover of [Indochine](https://indo.fr/), which was not that simple to realize, from a speaking french band that we love so much. Can make you cry in the street going to work in the morning.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Entracte Twist](https://requiempouruntwister.bandcamp.com/album/entracte-twist) – Hors Service
_Anaïs G_: **"**I do not know if it is the cellar atmosphere or the one of the parties to jump everywhere where the sweat is omnipresent that has seduced me so much at home .. But what I do know from listening to this group is that it doesn’t seem to warm it up! A color palette, a farandole of images directed by synths and guitars.**"**

## [Cate Le Bon](http://www.catelebon.com/) – Solitude
_Anaïs G_: **"**There is something touching in the voice of this Welsh musician and producer. A song that dates back to 2014, a bit off in style, sometimes reminiscent of the graceful and surprising singer [Kate Bush](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bush). We follow the rhythm by getting up on the right foot and as Cate Le Bon "Follow me"!**"**

## [Structures](https://structuresfr.bandcamp.com/releases) – Satellite
_Anaïs G_: **"**If I had to remember a single song from their EP ["Long Life"](https://soundcloud.com/structuresband/sets/ep-long-life) it would be "Satellite". It keeps us on our toes leaving room for the dark voice of Pierre Seguin, just perfect! This group from Amiens, shows us that the cold wave or the post punk is not dead, on the contrary...**"**

## [The Fat White Family](https://fatwhitefamily.bandcamp.com/) – Tastes Good With The Money
_Anaïs G_: **"**Definitely crazy, a bit provocative , [The Fat White Family](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_White_Family) does not disappoint us! A very pretty song, a colourful almost burlesque clip tinged with blood and violence, for a change (irony)... But also guitars that sizzle! It’s alive, beautiful and dirty at the same time, perfect to start the day.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday.
