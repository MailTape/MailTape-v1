<p id="introduction"> This morning, we take out the guitars, adjust our strings test the sound with the amp in boring neighbors...  And let our fingers slide so that we can wake up our faithful on Sunday morning.
<br><br>
New-wave and post punk for your awakening?  And why not ... " Twist" strays off the beaten track to offer us a selection worthy of the name.
</p>

# Entracte Twist's selection

##  Cocteau Twins – Sugar Hiccup
_Entacte Twist_: **"**What we have always listened to. We're big fan of Robin Guthrie's productions, it feel's like it's raining on reverberation. Going through winter in scotland in 1983 seemed to be such a cold and contemplative experience.**"**

## The Homesick – Half Aryan
_Entracte Twist_: **"**Great song from a great band from Netherlands, illustrating how good is the new post punk/ modern garage scene with bands like Women or Omni.**"**

## Requin Chagrin – Les Plus Mauvaises Nuits
_Entracte Twist_: **"**A traumatical cover of Indochine, which was not that simple to realize, from a speaking french band that we love so much. Can make you cry in the street going to work in the morning.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Entracte Twist – Hors Service
_Anaïs G_: **"** **"**

## Cate Le Bon – Solitude
_Anaïs G_: **"**there is something touching in the voice of this Welsh musician and producer. A song that dates back to 2014, a bit off in style, sometimes reminiscent of the graceful and surprising singer Kate Bush. We follow the rhythm by getting up on the right foot and as Cate Le Bon "Follow me"! **"**

## Structures – Satellite
_Anaïs G_: **"** **"**

## The Fat White Family – Tastes Good With The Money
_Anaïs G_: **"**Definitely crazy, a bit provocative , The Fat White Family does not disappoint us! A very pretty song, a colourful almost burlesque clip tinged with blood and violence, for a change (irony)... But also guitars that sizzle! It’s alive, beautiful and dirty at the same time, perfect to start the day.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to Entacte Twist for his Sunday selections, and to Camille Célestin for her brilliant illustration.</p>
