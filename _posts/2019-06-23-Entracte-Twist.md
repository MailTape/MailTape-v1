<p id="introduction"> This morning 
<br><br>

</p>

# Entracte Twist's selection

##  Cocteau Twins – Head Over Heels
_Entacte Twist_: **"**What we have always listened to. We're big fan of Robin Guthrie's productions, it feel's like it's raining on reverberation. Going through winter in scotland in 1983 seemed to be such a cold and contemplative experience.**"**

## The Homesick – Half Aryan
_Entracte Twist_: **"**Great song from a great band from Netherlands, illustrating how good is the new post punk/ modern garage scene with bands like Women or Omni.**"**

## Requin Chagrin – Les Plus Mauvaises Nuits
_Entracte Twist_: **"**A traumatical cover of Indochine, which was not that simple to realize, from a speaking french band that we love so much. Can make you cry in the street going to work in the morning.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Entracte Twist – Hors Service
_Anaïs G_: **"** **"**

## Cate Le Bon – Solitude
_Anaïs G_: **"** **"**

## Structures – Satellite
_Anaïs G_: **"** **"**

## The Fat White Family – Tastes Good With The Money
_Anaïs G_: **"** **"**
