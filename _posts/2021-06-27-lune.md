  This morning, close your eyes and see landscapes appearing on the inside of
  your closed eyelids as the music plays. Refrain from falling asleep but let
  yourself go as we'll enter a lucid dream state with Lüne starting this episode
  with a carefully crafted selection of ethereally vibrant and dreamy gems.
  We'll then keep exploring vivid sound textures and trippy soundscapes.
  Finally, we'll get back to our big blue marble and awake with replenished
  attention.

<p id="introduction">This morning, close your eyes and see landscapes appearing on the inside of your closed eyelids as the music plays. Refrain from falling asleep but let yourself go as we'll enter a lucid dream state with [Lüne](https://delalune.bandcamp.com/) starting this episode with a carefully crafted selection of ethereally vibrant and dreamy gems. We'll then keep exploring vivid sound textures and trippy soundscapes. Finally, we'll get back to our big blue marble and awake with replenished attention.</p>

# Lüne's selection

## [Témé Tan](https://soundcloud.com/teme-tan) - Ca Va Pas La Tête?
Lüne: **"**Inside every artist there’s a child and I feel like Teme Tan‘s music is a dialog with this inner child. It’s just full of colours full of life and it makes me smile and shake my body every time I hear it !**"**

## [Tōth](https://tothtunes.bandcamp.com/) - No Reason
Lüne: **"**No Reason is sort of an Hymn in my heart. When I listen to it I imagine hundreds of little LÜNEs singing along hands on the heart. It has an indescriptible magic in it.**"**

## [Sufjan Stevens](https://music.sufjan.com/) - Death with Dignity
Lüne: **"**This song is not joyful it is not sad it is. It’s as complex and as beautiful as life is. And it touches me in the deepest place.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Lüne](https://delalune.bandcamp.com/) - Bulle
ImaCrea: **"**We find in this track all the magic ingredients Lüne knows best to cook. Remember what you used to do on a long car trip in your childhood years? When you opened the window and let your hand fly in the air? As you were mimicking a plane or some bird flying freely along the landscape... That's the kind of spirit reactivated here.**"**

## [Jacques](https://jacques.bandcamp.com/) - hoohoohoo-hahaha
ImaCrea: **"**What can I write here? Jacques at his best. I regret being late at the party as it was released a year ago already. I kind of forgot the fella. But listening to Lüne somehow made me think about him and here we go. Still here and still very far at the same time. I couldn't resist.**"**

## [Andrew Bird](https://andrewbird.bandcamp.com/) - Lazuli Bunting
ImaCrea: **"**Another dreamer here. Turn off that synth and drum machines, we're going unplugged. Dancing in the air like a flying feather. This whole album by Andrew is a pure gem I get back to regularly when I need that quality of attention and calmness I use to find when walking in nature.**"**

## [Britton Powell](https://catchwaveltd.bandcamp.com/album/if-anything-is-ep) - If Anything Is
ImaCrea: **"**A dream in the dream. Open that door. The first one that comes to mind. No judgment, no expectation. Yes.**"** 

<p id="outroduction">How was it? Tell us freely in comment, we'd love to read you. As always, thank you for being with us. It was a real joy to welcome [Lüne](https://delalune.bandcamp.com/) for this dreamy Sunday selection. Great thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for her delicate illustration based on a picture by [Yanis Hamnane](https://bibliogram.snopyta.org/u/ynshmnn/).
