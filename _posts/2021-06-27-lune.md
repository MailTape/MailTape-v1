<p id="introduction">This morning, close your eyes and see landscapes appearing on the inside of your closed eyelids as the music plays. Refrain from falling asleep but let yourself go as we'll enter a lucid dream state with Lüne starting this episode with a carefully crafted selection of ethereally vibrant and dreamy gems. We'll then keep exploring vivid sound textures and trippy soundscapes. Finally, we'll get back to our big blue marble and awake with fresh attention to our close reality.</p>

# Lüne's selection

## Témé Tan - Ca Va Pas La Tête?
Lüne: **"**Inside every artist there’s a child and I feel like Teme Tan‘s music is a dialog with this inner child. It’s just full of colours full of life and it makes me smile and shake my body every time I hear it !**"**

## Tōth - No Reason
Lüne: **"**No Reason is sort of an Hymn in my heart. When I listen to it I imagine hundreds of little LÜNEs singing along hands on the heart. It has an indescriptible magic in it.**"**

## Sufjan Stevens - Death with Dignity
Lüne: **"**This song is not joyful it is not sad it is. It’s as complex and as beautiful as life is. And it touches me in the deepest place.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Lüne - Chamonix (feat. Kip Nelson)
ImaCrea: **"**xx**"**

## Jacques - hoohoohoo-hahaha
ImaCrea: **"**xx**"**

## Andrew Bird - Lazuli Bunting
ImaCrea: **"**xx**"**

## George Ka - Garçon Manqué Fille Manquante 
ImaCrea: **"**xx**"** 

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you for taking the time to listen. It was a joy and pleasure to welcome [Misha Panfilov](https://mpsc.bandcamp.com/) for this engaging Sunday selection. Great thanks to [Jason Pridham](https://www.instagram.com/grancharismo/?hl=en) for this episode's vibrant illustration.
