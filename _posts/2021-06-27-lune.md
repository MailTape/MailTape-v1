# Lüne's selection

## Témé Tan - Ca Va Pas La Tête?
Lüne: **"**Inside every artist there’s a child and I feel like Teme Tan‘s music is a dialog with this inner child. It’s just full of colours full of life and it makes me smile and shake my body every time I hear it !**"**

## Tōth - No Reason
Lüne: **"**No Reason is sort of an Hymn in my heart. When I listen to it I imagine hundreds of little LÜNEs singing along hands on the heart. It has an indescriptible magic in it.**"**

## Sufjan Stevens - Death with Dignity
Lüne: **"**This song is not joyful it is not sad it is. It’s as complex and as beautiful as life is. And it touches me in the deepest place.**"**
