<p id="introduction">
This morning our guest [Konstantin Sibold](https://www.facebook.com/KonstantinSiboldMastering "Like him on FB") is from Germany and has decided to make your day. If you were thinking about hiding yourself under your blanket, you’ve probably picked the wrong date. Germany is now world wide known for its underground electro music scene and Konstantin might be one of their most promising talent.</p>

# Get on your feets and do something
House music is probably the best invention ever for cleaning you place or any "physical but not so intellectual" activity. It actually makes you forget about everything as long as you keep focusing on what actually maters: the music. No need to stress yourself, the baseline is here to remind you the tempo and tell you how fast you should go. Now, press play and let the music do its job.

# His morning thoughts ...

## Nova Nova - Prisoner's Song
**"**Konstantin: I love the 5/8 time signature in this song, which has it compositional origin in Romania. This type of meter is more commonly found in eastern cultures but is here adopted nicely in a more western context. Everything in this song is beautiful, the melody, the instrumentation, the whole sound, the long build up reminding of a house track and then the perfect female vocal starting as a last element after 2 minutes.**"**

## David Byrne & St. Vincent - Lazarus
**"**Konstantin: My girlfriend Madeleine showed me this song some time ago. It has a great songwriting but translated in a very unique or strange way. It's hard to describe but it becomes more obvious the more you listen to it. Future oldschool pop with a nice balance between harmony and dissonance.**"**

## Rootstrax - Harlequin
**"**Konstantin: Since I'm producing a perhaps confusing wide range of music from house and techno to indie pop, I get booked to a wide range of events from vinyl only nerd crowds to big room deephouse party people. But nevertheless there are some records in my bag which I always carry around and this track is one of them. It's just perfect and peaceful, it doesn't try to be bigger than it is and it works so well in many different situations.**"**
