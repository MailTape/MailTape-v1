<p id="introduction">
This morning, our guest' selection will probably widen your morning musical horizon! Please welcome on stage the Manchester based trumpeter [Matthew Halsall](https://soundcloud.com/matthewhalsall "Matthew Halsall Soundcloud").</p>

# The Jazz Heroe of our generation

Beauty wins over strong opinion. This morning, have a seat, forget the word Jazz, prepare to meditate and turn on one of [Matthew Halsall's albums](http://matthewhalsall.bandcamp.com/ "Matthew Halsall Bandcamp") he released on his own label [Gondwana Records](http://www.gondwanarecords.com/ "Gondwana Records Website"). Subtle references, heart-warming tones and fresh musical landscapes will arise. We hope you'll enjoy his sunday morning cocktail.

# His morning inspiration

## Harpista - He Has a Name (Awareness)
_Matthew Halsall:_ **"**Anyone who listens to my music will know how much I love the harp work of Alice Coltrane and Dorothy Ashby and I recently discovered this amazing new harpist Brandee Younger based in Brooklyn, United States. This track is very refreshing and perfect for a Sunday morning.**"**

## The Cinematic Orchestra - Necrology
_Matthew Halsall:_ **"**On a slightly more electronic tip The Cinematic Orchestra's latest offering Motion Pt. 1 features a track called Necrology which builds beautifully. If you are a fan of Steve Reich as I am you'll love this! another beauty to slowly wake you up on a lazy Sunday morning.**"**

## Phil France - The Swimmer
_Matthew Halsall:_ **"**And finally here's a real special one from The Cinematic Orchestra's bassist Phil France. This track has been one of the most played tracks on my home stereo over the last eight months. It's so uplifting and makes me feel like I'm about to take off.**"**
