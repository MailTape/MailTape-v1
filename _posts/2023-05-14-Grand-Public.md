<p id="introduction">
	This morning, We take advantage of this month of May to breathe, relax and take advantage of the many public holidays to get away with it. One watchword: do nothing, just enjoy the present time! It is with the musical selection of the band [Grand Public](https://grandpublic.bandcamp.com/music) that we will put in off mode. "[Ideal Tempo](https://grandpublic.bandcamp.com/album/id-al-tempo-2)", released on March 24th, is the only tempo to have this weekend.
</p>

# Grand Public's selection

## [Zwan](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwan) - Lyric

Grand Public: **"**Bona fide supergroup: Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin from [Smashing Pumpkins](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins); David Pajo from [Slint](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slint); Paz Lenchantin, currently in [Pixies](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies); Matt Sweeney from Chavez and countless others, look him up! Their one and only album, Mary Star of the Sea, just celebrated its 20-year anniversary. Flawless it is not, but many great moments. This is the opening track and it really goes for it. Rousing number. **"**

##  [Tangerine Dream](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Dream) -  Love on a Real Train

Grand Public: **"**Legendary German band who provided the score to many beloved 1980s movies, perhaps most famously 1983’s Risky Business, which "Love on a Real Train" is taken from. Not digging too deep here as this is among their most celebrated tracks, for good reason. It was reprised to great effect in [Noah Baumbach](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Baumbach) in 2005’s "[The Squid and the Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squid_and_the_Whale)". Endlessly evocative. Formed in the late 1960s, they just announced a tour with a stop in our hometown of Montreal. **"**

## [The Courtneys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courtneys) -  Tour

Grand Public: **"**Hard to put a date on it but pre-pandemic, three of us in Grand Public attended a show they played in a rather lo-fi venue here in Montreal, total blast. This is from their 2017 album II which is filled with swirling hooks and cool tones. Still waiting on the follow up. **"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Grand Public](https://grandpublic.bandcamp.com/music) - Assez Apparement

Anaïs G: **"**A guitar playing, a voice that resonates like our consciousness and something cheerful and nonchalant at the same time. This is what Grand Public offers a hypnotic, enthralling and joyful music. **"**

## [Sonic Youth](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth) - Reena

Anaïs G: **"**A rock sound like we like them from an American band formed in the 80s, which plunges us back with this title dating from 2006 into our adolescence. **"**

## [Vampire Weekend](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Knight) - Everlasting Arms

Anaïs G: **"**We recognize this group directly with its lead singer [Ezra Koenig](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Koenig) who exists since 2006. There would be so many tracks selected like "A-punk" or "Cousins". But for this Sunday morning, we play it easy with their title "Everlasting Arms". It's a pleasure! **"**


## [Thus Owls](http://www.thusowls.com/) - I Forget What I Remembered

Anaïs G: **"**We end the playlist with something calm signed by a Swedish-Canadian band Thus Owls. Well done experimental indie-rock, with the singer piercing our hearts and shivering us with her voice. Strong emotions almost perceptible at every note of music. My favorite of the moment! **"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today! Thanks for being with us dear folks. Thanks a lot to [Grand Public](https://grandpublic.bandcamp.com/music)for her blissful selection. And bravo to [Thibault Daumain](https://thibaultdaumain.fr/)
