# Grand Public's selection

## Zwan - Lyric

Grand Public: **"**Bona fide supergroup: Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin from Smashing Pumpkins; David Pajo from Slint; Paz Lenchantin, currently in Pixies; Matt Sweeney from Chavez and countless others, look him up! Their one and only album, Mary Star of the Sea, just celebrated its 20-year anniversary. Flawless it is not, but many great moments. This is the opening track and it really goes for it. Rousing number. **"**

## Love on a Real Train - Tangerine Dream

Grand Public: **"**Legendary German band who provided the score to many beloved 1980s movies, perhaps most famously 1983’s Risky Business, which Love on a Real Train is taken from. Not digging too deep here as this is among their most celebrated tracks, for good reason. It was reprised to great effect in Noah Baumbach in 2005’s The Squid and the Whale. Endlessly evocative. Formed in the late 1960s, they just announced a tour with a stop in our hometown of Montreal. **"**

## The Courtneys -  Tour

Grand Public: **"**Hard to put a date on it but pre-pandemic, three of us in Grand Public attended a show they played in a rather lo-fi venue here in Montreal, total blast. This is from their 2017 album II which is filled with swirling hooks and cool tones. Still waiting on the follow up. **"**
