# Joakim’s selection

## Akira - Kaneda's Theme
_Joakim_: **"**There is kind of a manga sound track influence into my album but in a indirect way. It is not directly influenced by this kind of music but also by the experimental music which have been inspired by manga. I think about Oneohtrix Point Never for example, who has directly been influenced by this kind of music a lot, like the soundtrack of Ghost in the Shell. 

I believe Oneohtrix is probably the most interesting artist at the moment in experimental music. Full stop. I've actually always been very influenced by japanese culture which has been fascinating me for a while. I was even reading Mishima when while writing the album. It surely influenced me a lot during the making of the album, like the track Samurai for example. **"**

## Workdub - Caravan 
_Joakim_: **"**This is a track which has been reedited by the label Music for Memory, a Dutch label founded by Taco, one of the greatest digger I know. They do a lot a reedition of dudes from the 80s 90s with a sort of DIY style. This is an approach which is somehow quite comparable to mine. I have been quite inspired by all of the records they recently published. 

They all are very ambiant style music and sort of new age, done with sort of very limited resources. This particular track is really funky but with a Talking Heads touch as well. It fully corresponds to the music I like, which is hard to define and sort of challenges genres.**"**

## Dwight Sykes - You That I Need
_Joakim_: **"**This one is very DIY style too, but this one is pure funk. I think it was produced in the 80's, and reedited by the American Label PPU. It may be related to the fact that I moved to NYC, but there are a few funk tracks which inspired me lately, ans especially this kind of funk from the early 80s, with lots beat box, Prince, etc.. A very slapped bass line.

I often start to work on tracks from a groove. That's very important to me. That's why I am really obsessed by this kind of music.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Max Future - Till you Let Go
_ImaCrea_: **"** A low beat envelop a very high voice during synthes evaporate from Le Havre harbor. This track raise up like lovers who have just met.   **"** 

## JuJu Rogers & Bluestaeb - Get Lost Feat. Regis Molina
_ImaCrea_: **"** JuJu Rogers and Bluestaeb are back in da house with there smooth and brisk hip-hop. From Germany with flow, they deliver perfect vibe for this sunday. Let's Get Lost guys. **"**

## Buttering Trio - From The Tree
_ImaCrea_: **"** I follow them since long time and didn't get the success they deserve, at all. It can"t be like this anymore. From Tel Aviv, Butturing Trio make the most classy and original dub I've heard since longtime. [Two crazy producers behind a saxophonist/singer frontgirl](https://youtu.be/HsfzMudFWHA) is the recipe. **"**

+ ## Ryder The Eagle - It's All About The Music
_ImaCrea_: **"**This track is all about [temporality](https://youtu.be/D9-R2RDXRWo). Its construction has pushed me. There is a concrete beggining, there is an end, OK. But there isn't a middle, and you're constantly waiting for the drop who gonna bring you to the heart of the song. But there isn't and at the end, you just realize that you've loved it !  **"**
