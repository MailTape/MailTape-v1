<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are delighted to welcome Palestinian DJ and electronic music producer [SAMA'](http://www.samaahadi.com/) to pick three Sunday morning musical selections for us.
<br><br>

Born in Jordan, Sama Abdulhadi grew up in Ramallah and is one of the very first artists to emerge from the West Bank region. Initially active in the early-2000s hip hop scene, she started mixing in 2006 in the first techno nights around the city, at a time when “the only DJs in Ramallah were wedding DJs”. In late 2018, [SAMA’s Boiler Room performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9VYKrtziSg) and the associated [documentary about the underground Palestinian scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-R8S7QwO1g) went viral and shed light on this electric, vibrant community. 
[SAMA'](https://www.facebook.com/sama.saad/) is also working as an audio engineer and managing Awyav, the publishing agency she founded to represent independent Arab artists. She is now working on the release of her album.

# Elodie Rama's selection

## CM Jones - Remain
Elodie Rama: **"**CM Jones is a French/American duo composed of producer Creestal and emcee Moshadee. The production and vocale are classy and timeless just like the whole LP. Creestal is based in Marseille and he’s one of the first musician i met when i moved here. Now we work together, he’s my music soulmate !**"**

## Varnish La Piscine - Bubble
Elodie Rama: **"**The vibe of this tune is so funky, it makes me want to dance instantly. To me it’s a feelgood music and i like the fact that it’s sung in French. It’s quite unusual to have this style of music in French.**"**

## Témé Tan - Le Ciel 
Elodie Rama: **"**Témé Tan has this unique sound, modern and traditional at the same time. He’s a great performer and singer, i fell in love with his music a while ago. In a general matter, i'm feeling deeply connected to his music because it sounds so personal and honest. We became friends few years ago thanks to the internet and we’re family now!**"**
