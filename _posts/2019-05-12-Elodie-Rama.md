<p id="introduction">This morning, we walk through the deserted streets of a city (of your choice). Whether we return from the evening, or we decide to buy a croissants, the selection of Elodie Rama accompanies us in our ears this Sunday.
<br><br>

A dose of jazz, a hint of soul and a twist of folk ! This artist’s universe fascinates us and impregnates with her origins and experiences. Elodie Rama is a singer, an imposing voice, but she is also a visual artist and fashion designer.</p>



# Elodie Rama's selection

## CM Jones - Remain feat King Krab
Elodie Rama: **"**CM Jones is a French/American duo composed of producer Creestal and emcee Moshadee. The production and vocale are classy and timeless just like the whole LP. Creestal is based in Marseille and he’s one of the first musician i met when i moved here. Now we work together, he’s my music soulmate !**"**

## Varnish La Piscine - Bubble
Elodie Rama: **"**The vibe of this tune is so funky, it makes me want to dance instantly. To me it’s a feelgood music and i like the fact that it’s sung in French. It’s quite unusual to have this style of music in French.**"**

## Témé Tan x Le Motel - Le Ciel 
Elodie Rama: **"**Témé Tan has this unique sound, modern and traditional at the same time. He’s a great performer and singer, i fell in love with his music a while ago. In a general matter, i'm feeling deeply connected to his music because it sounds so personal and honest. We became friends few years ago thanks to the internet and we’re family now!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Elodie Rama - Home 
Anaïs G: **"**A favourite for this artist discovered at the end of 2018. With as collaborators Creestal (duo of the CM Jones group and boss of the label Munchie Records) or Blanka (member of La Fine Equipe), Elodie Rama offers us a return worthy of his name with "H O M E", the song smile par excellence with a very aesthetic and stylish clip.**"**

## Celeste - Summer feat Jeshi
Anaïs G: **"**How can we not love that satin voice that caresses our bodies and tingles our hearts? His EP "Lately" released last March, is a condensed nugget soul where one does not know how to give head.**"**

## Rosie Lowe - Pharoah
Anaïs G: **"**At the beginning of this piece, the guitar chords are enough to make me melt with pleasure. Extract of his second opus "YU" released on May 10, "Pharoah" poses us in a sensual soul with its lascivious voice and a sophisticated look that leaves us speechless.**"**

## Yazmin Lacey - Black Moon 
Anaïs G: **"**New signature of the label Brownswood Recordings, this singer from Nottingham transports us through his influences jazzy, r'n'b or neo soul. My devotee jumped on the song "Black Moon" released in 2017, a concentrate of good mood and chill. the perfect song for a Sunday chill!**"**
