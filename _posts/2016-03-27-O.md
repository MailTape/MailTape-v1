<p id="introduction"> The French musician Olivier Marguerit needed a clear framework to use and emancipate his huge musical lyricism. But it couldn't be the same as other. He choosed this frame : " **O** "
</p>

[**O**](https://www.facebook.com/OOhmMusic/) his a kingdom where only his souvereign know his borders, as huge his universe seems vast for us. Metaphors as gates, the world of O is a maze of figures of speech and sophisticated musicals arrangements. A world straight out of a brain who dream about finding the legendary equilibrium between extravaganza and classicism. 

# The Wizard of O

Far from the usual Pop format (verse/refrain), Olivier Marguerit's songs come to life by the constant clash of two extremes which coexist in his mind. If his lyricism seem so inflamed, it's because of the quality of refined breathing times. The Ying and the Yang in the same song. **O** doesn't know the words "compromise" or "happy medium". His own diplomatic solution is to force these extrems to cohabit. Do somersaults with them by multiplying goldsmith arrangements. 

As you could understant, **O** doesn't choose the easy way. Without corner to hide, **O** never reveal frontally his intimacy , but very subtly and poetically. His verity is behind his high-pitched voice who plays to lose us in meandering shapes of sounds and poetry. You can't fight, just let him guides you.

Listenning the first album of [**O**](http://oohmmusic.com/) "Un Torrent, La Boue" is like being in rapids of a crazy river, you can't really see where you go, but you can be sure to be in the right stream.
 
# O's selection:

## Ricky Hollywood - La Campagne 

O: "I know Ricky because we play together in Halo Maud. He is a fine musician and like me , he likes to accompany others. He also defended a solo project which is quite exciting. I had the chance to listen to some songs from his first album to come, and it's great. I would like it to be very well known , and make everyone sings his songs in the street. The world would be more beautiful"

## Athanase Granson - That Blue Vocoder

O: "This is an alternate version of this song that I love ( The Blue ). Athanase had the courtesy to invite me to open the first concert of O. I'm crazy about his first album and I know a new one is finished and will be released soon. I am now waiting for that."

## Shorebilly - Drifting towards the unknown

O: "Shorebilly was my partner in Syd Matters. We shared the guitar, keyboards and vocals. He is about to release his first EP, sophisticated mix of pop, metronomic synths and soulful voice. I find his music very soul-stirring. It's turns out, discovered and cherished. This is a master tune !"
