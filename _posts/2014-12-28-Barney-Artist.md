<p id="introduction">
This morning, we bring you a Mailtape curated in collaboration with [Barney Artist](http://www.barneyartist.com "Barney Artist's website"). Now, as you have eaten this week more than the combined total of what you will eat in the coming weeks, we thought you might desire a sweet tape to put an end to your insatiable Christmas craving. </p>
 
# Chill hip-hop
 
We truly believe Barney Artist will be a "hit" in 2015. His EP [Bespoke](https://soundcloud.com/barneyartist/sets/bespoke-1 "Listen to Bespoke") is dope. On _Space_ he worked with [Tom Misch](http://mailta.pe/147/Tom-Misch/ "Tom Misch's Mailtape") - you might remember him from a previous episode - and the track is pure chill.

Barney’s selection is the smoothest so we wanted to complete it with a tinge of mellow hip-hop and an ounce of harsh beats.
 
# Barney Artist's morning inspiration
 
## Jordan Rakei - Add The Bassline (Nehzuil Remix)
_Barney Artist:_ **"**I'm a huge Jordan Rakei fan : really love his voice and the musicality of his songs. When I heard this Nehzuil remix of Add The Bassline lets just say it was played every Sunday from then on. Great vibes!**"**
 
## Alfa & Emmavie - Easily, I Forget
_Barney Artist:_ **"**So, I had to throw some of my musical family in the mix of this Sunday playlist. Alfa Mist and Emmavie made an incredible EP called _Epoch_ earlier this year and it was so difficult to choose just one song from it but _Easily I forget_ stands out as its melodies, instrumentation and lyrics throw you into a trance.**"**
 
## IDEH - Do Something
_Barney Artist:_ **"**This track is by a really cool new artist from London _Ideh_. This song reminds me a lot of Brandy on her _Afrodisiac_ album really love the production by V beats and the tones from Ideh. Have a listen and vibe out with me this Sunday.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to our guest [Barney Artist](http://www.barneyartist.com "Barney Artist's website") for his amazing selection, to Alex and Siddhartha. Enjoy your sunday and thank you for listening!
