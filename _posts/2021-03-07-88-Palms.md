# 88 Palms's selection

## Daft Punk – Something About Us
88 Palms: **"**I think this is one of the most perfect songs of all time. I’ve probably heard it hundreds of times and each time it gets me in all the right places. The analogue warmth of the keys, the warped funky bass line with the synthetic longing of the vocals to me sounds exactly what a robot in love might sound like. This is it for me. If I could ever write a song that makes me feel the way this song does I can die happy. Daft Punk’s Discovery was the first new album I bought when I started collecting records, and I bought it mainly to hear this song as God aka Daft Punk intended.**"**

## Spandau Ballet – True
88 Palms: **"**Another one for the perfection vault. It’s a beautiful 80s homage to Motown. The silky smooth vocals and the evocative lyrics like “With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue…listening to Marvin [Gaye] all night long” brings me straight to that 80s cocaine Miami yacht aesthetic that I feel very much at home in. Not to mention the sax solos I mean come on. I unironically find this song very sexy, especially if you’ve seen the iconic image of the band inside the record sleeve of the original album. What a bunch of hunks. I often wake up on Sunday morning and put on this record.**"**

## Aretha Franklin – I Never Loved a Man (The Way That I Love You) 
88 Palms: **"**This one gets me right in the feels. I think it’s a song that’s highly relatable to just about everyone who’s experienced heartbreak and unrequited love. The way she wails from the depths of her soul you know it’s true, and every time I sing this song it makes me feel the same way. I end up exploring my various relationships through the songs I write, and I’m always surprised that certain people never seem to leave my mind, because songs like this bring those feelings rushing back. Songs are valuable little time capsules in that way.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## 88 Palms  – Hello
Sarah: **"**grooves, can't wait for clubs to open. absolute gem of an ep
love the melt of this bass and vocal echoes 
**"**

## The Main Ingredient – Summer Breeze
Sarah: **"**This track is my absolute favorite version of Summer Breeze, and I'll take any excuse to play it. Released in 1974 on the Euphrates River album, Cuba Gooding's vocals have the most soothing and powerful presence, stirring up a summer breeze you can really feel. Guiding the song's movement, Gooding adds so much richness to the already flourishing accents of harp, violin, and xylophone. Seamless and so magical :) **"**

## Heatwave – Boogie Nights
Sarah: **"**Another throwback to the 70's (I couldn't in my right mind leave this one out of this disco/funk playlist). This is the extended version appearing on Heatwave's album, and in this version, you can hear the jazz guitar and harp opening. The pinacle of funk and disco.**"**

## Kuzich – Rinjani Nights
Sarah: **"**A beautifully lilting piece from [Talvin Singh](https://www.instagram.com/talvinsinghmusic/?hl=en) and [Niladri Kumar](https://www.niladrikumar.com/)'s album, Together, which I now find difficult to believe was released almost a decade ago! Niladri's sprightly sitar melodies emerge from Talvin's exhilarating tabla percussion, before being 
delectably spliced and diced in post-production.**"**
