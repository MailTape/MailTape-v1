# 88 Palms's selection

## Daft Punk – Something About Us
88 Palms: **"**I think this is one of the most perfect songs of all time. I’ve probably heard it hundreds of times and each time it gets me in all the right places. The analogue warmth of the keys, the warped funky bass line with the synthetic longing of the vocals to me sounds exactly what a robot in love might sound like. This is it for me. If I could ever write a song that makes me feel the way this song does I can die happy. Daft Punk’s Discovery was the first new album I bought when I started collecting records, and I bought it mainly to hear this song as God aka Daft Punk intended.**"**

## Spandau Ballet – True
88 Palms: **"**Another one for the perfection vault. It’s a beautiful 80s homage to Motown. The silky smooth vocals and the evocative lyrics like “With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue…listening to Marvin [Gaye] all night long” brings me straight to that 80s cocaine Miami yacht aesthetic that I feel very much at home in. Not to mention the sax solos I mean come on. I unironically find this song very sexy, especially if you’ve seen the iconic image of the band inside the record sleeve of the original album. What a bunch of hunks. I often wake up on Sunday morning and put on this record.**"**

## Aretha Franklin – I Never Loved a Man (The Way That I Love You) 
88 Palms: **"**This one gets me right in the feels. I think it’s a song that’s highly relatable to just about everyone who’s experienced heartbreak and unrequited love. The way she wails from the depths of her soul you know it’s true, and every time I sing this song it makes me feel the same way. I end up exploring my various relationships through the songs I write, and I’m always surprised that certain people never seem to leave my mind, because songs like this bring those feelings rushing back. Songs are valuable little time capsules in that way.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## 88 Palms  – Hello
Sarah: **"**The number of fantastic tracks from this album, Love Safari, made this choice a bit difficult to make. But this one made me miss club dancefloors the most. There's such an easy groove throughout this track, I love the magic the synths add to this killer bassline and Ria's timeless vocals. Everything added melts together in the most lusciious way - the piano flourishes, the vocal echoes stepping over and into each other, and the edging of this bassline into the forefront.**"**

## The Main Ingredient – Summer Breeze
Sarah: **"**This track is my favorite version of Summer Breeze, and I'll take any excuse to play it. Released in 1974 on the Euphrates River album, Cuba Gooding's vocals have the most soothing and powerful presence, stirring up a summer breeze you can really feel, and maybe planting some jasmine in your mind, too :) Guiding the song's movement, Gooding adds so much richness to the already flourishing accents of harp, violin, and xylophone. Seamless and so magical. Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.**"**

## TRKRNR – No Summer Days (feat. Trailer Limon)
Sarah: **"**Love how the smoothness of the vocals and bassline set the tone of thiis track from its beginning. The sax brings the track to another level. A lot to love :)**"**

## Kuzich – Rinjani Nights
Sarah: **"**Off of Kuzich's 2018 album, Dawn Chorus, this track runs through so many motions, each building into the next. This opening beat and rhythm caught my ear first, and very early on, with soft vocals and sax accents, my hear was won over. The funk bassline and comping adds so much dynamicism to an already interesting track.**"**
