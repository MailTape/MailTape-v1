# 88 Palms's selection

## Daft Punk – Something About Us
88 Palms: **"**I think this is one of the most perfect songs of all time. I’ve probably heard it hundreds of times and each time it gets me in all the right places. The analogue warmth of the keys, the warped funky bass line with the synthetic longing of the vocals to me sounds exactly what a robot in love might sound like. This is it for me. If I could ever write a song that makes me feel the way this song does I can die happy. Daft Punk’s Discovery was the first new album I bought when I started collecting records, and I bought it mainly to hear this song as God aka Daft Punk intended.**"**

## Spandau Ballet – True
88 Palms: **"**Another one for the perfection vault. It’s a beautiful 80s homage to Motown. The silky smooth vocals and the evocative lyrics like “With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue…listening to Marvin [Gaye] all night long” brings me straight to that 80s cocaine Miami yacht aesthetic that I feel very much at home in. Not to mention the sax solos I mean come on. I unironically find this song very sexy, especially if you’ve seen the iconic image of the band inside the record sleeve of the original album. What a bunch of hunks. I often wake up on Sunday morning and put on this record.**"**

## Aretha Franklin – I Never Loved a Man (The Way That I Love You) 
88 Palms: **"**This one gets me right in the feels. I think it’s a song that’s highly relatable to just about everyone who’s experienced heartbreak and unrequited love. The way she wails from the depths of her soul you know it’s true, and every time I sing this song it makes me feel the same way. I end up exploring my various relationships through the songs I write, and I’m always surprised that certain people never seem to leave my mind, because songs like this bring those feelings rushing back. Songs are valuable little time capsules in that way.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## 88 Palms  – Elephantine
Sarah: **"**Sharing this oud/piano duet with [Sam Shalabi](https://www.musicworks.ca/sam-shalabi-and-evolution-global-aesthetic), which we recorded at La Sala Rossa concert hall in the morning, we worked with some friends to set-up a recording situation and worked on releasing this track on the album [Flying Street](https://spirodon.bandcamp.com/album/--2) on a community level, it is out on vinyl. I remember the conversations with Sam around this piece, the musical scales are rooted in Nubian music and I loved playing the same note in two octaves, along to the driving melody of the oud, two notes striking accents on the piano while the oud plays. Sam is a great person, I feel lucky to have gotten to know Sam and to have collaborated over the years. Our collaborations first were really driven within the context of a series of local concerts we worked on in the city to support Palestinian human rights and the global [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement](https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi). It has taken time but at the grassroots level, within artistic networks and amongst cultural workers, there is growing support for the BDS movement, as rooted in the example of the way that sanctions and boycotts did help the liberation struggle against apartheid in South Africa. On a personal level I have learned so much from Sam, both musically and also personally, just how to sustain a meaningful, honest and chill presence in a difficult world, thank you Sam.**"**

## Murcof – Underwater Lament
Sarah: **"**Girona-based producer and composer Fernando Corona, also known as [Murcof](https://www.murcof.com/), has announced his first release—'The Alias Sessions', a collaboration with Brazilian choreographer [Guilherme Botelho](https://www.alias-cie.com/en/)—on the Leaf label since 2016. More abstract than many of his previous works, I love the diaphanous atmosphere in this track, incorporating exquisite sound design with ghostly samples and non-tonal sounds. [Check out the choreography on the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ti6u3IRnx4).**"**

## Sibusile Xaba – Wampona
Sarah: **"**[Sibusile Xaba's music](https://sibusilexaba.bandcamp.com/album/ngiwu-shwabada) has been on regular rotation since I first came across his work in the wet summer of 2017. Like the great Philip Tabane, Sibusile mixes fragmented lines with repeated phrases over Thabang Tabane's drums. Accompanied by his vocal style that is part-dreamscaping and part ancestral invocation. If you've got even more time on your hands, listen to [Sibusile's MailTape episode from August 2017](https://www.mailta.pe/275/sibusile-xaba/).**"**

## Talvin Singh & Niladri Kumar – Ananta
Sarah: **"**A beautifully lilting piece from [Talvin Singh](https://www.instagram.com/talvinsinghmusic/?hl=en) and [Niladri Kumar](https://www.niladrikumar.com/)'s album, Together, which I now find difficult to believe was released almost a decade ago! Niladri's sprightly sitar melodies emerge from Talvin's exhilarating tabla percussion, before being 
delectably spliced and diced in post-production.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us.
