<p id="introduction">TThis week, your weekly doze of tracks has been prepared with the help of an amazing Austrian duo : HVOB (Her Voice Over Boys). Their selection is a one-way ticket to the world of thougths. We completed it with a couple of very strong and inspirational tunes.</p>

# HVOB, a deep ocean of house music.

Listening to new sounds has always been the best rewards for hours spent scouting for new talents. When I first listened to HVOB, I instantly knew that I had found one of those unique bands which are somehow defining music genras. What is even more amazing with HVOB, is their ability to accomplish this with harmony. Strong basslines, sweet melodies and the aerial voice of Anna Müller are the secrets of this wonder. Enjoy.

# Their enchanting selection.

+ ## Radiohead - Lotus Flower (Jacques Greene Remix)
_Deluxe_: **"**Radiohead is the best band in the world. Thom Yorke is one of the best musicians in the world. Maybe he‘s not the best dancer in the world. But this is one of my favourite remixes.**"**

+ ## The XX - Finally by Kings of Tomorrow (cover)
_Deluxe_: **"**The XX covering the house classic "Finally" by Kings of Tomorrow in a BBC1 live session. It‘s huge.**"**

+ ## Twin Sister - I Want a House
_Deluxe_: **"**So in love with this one. Makes everything fall into place. Especially on a Sunday.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all for today folks. A big thank you to HVOB.</p>
