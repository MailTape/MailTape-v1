# Mathilde Fernandez's selection

## [Mansfield TYA](https://www.instagram.com/chaama_z/) - Ni Morte, Ni Connue
Mathilde Fernandez: **«**This is from their new album; I have always loved the writting of Julia Lanoe, she's excellent. I am such a fan since her project "Sexy Sushi" all her texts find a way to touch my heart, in their violence or in their beauty and justness ( je sais pas si ça se dit comme ça... :-/ )**»**


## Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare - 2 coro delle lavendaire 1998
Mathilde Fernandez: **«**Nothing better to start the day with a very powerful rythm and sun vibes. This musical project has begun in Napoli in the late 60's in the goal to research and spread the traditional and ancient music from south italy. They sing old songs that haven't survived, using ancient manuscrits and using forgotter music instruments.**»**

## Zinda Reinhardt - Troumli
Mathilde Fernandez: **«**I love this girl, she reminds me the real punks like Nina Hagen, she sings in "Sintikès" language from est europe, the tongue of her ancestors; Her musical project is very unique.**»**
