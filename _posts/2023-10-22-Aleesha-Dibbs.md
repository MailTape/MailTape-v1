<p id="introduction">
	This Sunday morning we welcome Aleesha Dibbs for Episode 538. Based in Sydney, Aleesha Dibbs joins us after the release of her debut solo EP, Paradise Lost - produced and co-written by Tom Crandles. Marked by eccentric snythwork and rich vocals, the release often treads darker, haunting tones with exceptional inventiveness.

# Aleesha Dibbs's selection

## Sol Seppy - Slo Fuzz

Aleesha Dibbs: **"**Sol Seppy is a recent discovery for me - I was completely captured on first listen. On her track 'Slo Fuzz' in particular her production and ethereal vocals literally melted me. I initially heard it while walking down a really beautiful, deserted beach on the Central Coast in Australia on sunset. There's always a mystical pocket on dusk when the clouds reflect on a silky shoreline so you're kind of walking on air... the euphoric lift in the chorus was poignant at this moment.**"**

## David Bowie - Black Star

Aleesha Dibbs: **"**This is the most incredible track from Bowie's final and very potent album. I ended up in a music video watching Youtube portal the other night and was in tears re-watching the 'Black Star' clip - to think his health was suffering so severely whilst in the process of making the record, and that he left the world just two days after it's release is overwhelming. His artistic integrity and genius was so powerful literally up until his final body of work.**"**

## Laura Jean - A Funny Thing Happened 

Aleesha Dibbs: **"**I've listened to Laura Jean's most recent album 'Amateurs' a lot since its release. The track 'A Funny Thing Happened' resonated with me the most - really beautiful arrangements and harmonies. There's a really powerful sense of nostalgia to this track.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Aleesha Dibbs - Comin For Me Now

Sarah: **"**Across the  Paradise Lost EP, the intricacy within the synthwork carries such a brooding richness. The EP's four songs weave into their own epic, drawing listeners deeper with each track, and this is the last. As Dibbs describes, the creation of the EP embodied a "monstrous two years" and its symbolized "a big, happy, metaphorical closing of a door." The description is especially interesting when experiencing Comin For Me Now as the EP's last track, the last word before the door's closing. Although the last word, this track strikes at once haunting and then accelerating tones, a chasing of sorts. With each listen through the EP, I found drawn to begin again, to go back to Batallion, through to Distance, Conjured You Up, and found myself embedded in the spiral of these tracks, their connective tissue and the weight they came to represent.**"**

## FBC & VHOOR - Quando O DJ Toca

Sarah: **"**Here's an instant banger for you. Movement is what breathes life into our bodies. Let's dance and let the rhythm carry us away. Those are the moments I cherish, when I stumble upon a track online, and I can already tell it's going to stay in my vibe for days and days...**"**

## Nyami Nyami - Oceanic Sands

Sarah: **"**Stepping away from FBC & VHOOR's dancefloor, Nyami Nyami's 'Oceanic Sands' hits you like a musical tidal wave. It's a wild ride from one extreme to another, but damn, it's worth every moment of the switch-up.**"**

## Vanishing Twin - Afternoon X

Sarah: **"**Fascinated by this new release from Vanishing Twin, the namesake of their album released earlier this month. The cyclical rhythm section is disrupted and then enhanced, hypnotic in its creativity and subtle transformations.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today! Thank you for joining us; let's keep the good vibes flowing. Much love to Blick Bassy for his invigorating selection, perfectly suited to kick off this new season with a big smile. Let's give a round of applause to Noémie for her delightful illustration. See you next Sunday.</p>
