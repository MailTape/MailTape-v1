# Aleesha Dibbs's selection

## Sol Seppy - Slo Fuzz

Aleesha Dibbs: **"**Sol Seppy is a recent discovery for me - I was completely captured on first listen. On her track 'Slo Fuzz' in particular her production and ethereal vocals literally melted me. I initially heard it while walking down a really beautiful, deserted beach on the Central Coast in Australia on sunset. There's always a mystical pocket on dusk when the clouds reflect on a silky shoreline so you're kind of walking on air... the euphoric lift in the chorus was poignant at this moment.**"**

## David Bowie - Black Star

Aleesha Dibbs: **"**This is the most incredible track from Bowie's final and very potent album. I ended up in a music video watching Youtube portal the other night and was in tears re-watching the 'Black Star' clip - to think his health was suffering so severely whilst in the process of making the record, and that he left the world just two days after it's release is overwhelming. His artistic integrity and genius was so powerful literally up until his final body of work.**"**

## Laura Jean - A Funny Thing Happened 

Aleesha Dibbs: **"**I've listened to Laura Jean's most recent album 'Amateurs' a lot since its release. The track 'A Funny Thing Happened' resonated with me the most - really beautiful arrangements and harmonies. There's a really powerful sense of nostalgia to this track.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Aleesha Dibbs - Comin For Me Now

Sarah: **"**Blick Bassy's new album, Mádibá, is a true celebration of life. I especially love this track for its fusion of electro with the rich musical roots of the Baasa language in Cameroon, creating a spiritually uplifting blend that achieves a perfect balance and exquisite harmony. You can immediately sense the maturity of a great artist and the characteristic electro touch from Infiné. It's a must-listen on these sunny days of the new season, preferably while riding your bike.**"**

## FBC & VHOOR - Quando O DJ Toca

Sarah: **"**Here's an instant banger for you. Movement is what breathes life into our bodies. Let's dance and let the rhythm carry us away. Those are the moments I cherish, when I stumble upon a track online, and I can already tell it's going to stay in my vibe for days and days...**"**

## Nyami Nyami - Oceanic Sands

Sarah: **"**Stepping away from FBC & VHOOR's dancefloor, Nyami Nyami's 'Oceanic Sands' hits you like a musical tidal wave. It's a wild ride from one extreme to another, but damn, it's worth every moment of the switch-up.**"**

## Beverly Glenn-Copeland - People of the Loon

Sarah: **"**Returning to a spiritual atmosphere with the legendary artist Beverly Glenn-Copeland, we delve into a reflection on our ways of existence, in line with the concept of 'adjusted regards' coined by philosopher Baptiste Morizot.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today! Thank you for joining us; let's keep the good vibes flowing. Much love to Blick Bassy for his invigorating selection, perfectly suited to kick off this new season with a big smile. Let's give a round of applause to Noémie for her delightful illustration. See you next Sunday.</p>
