# Blick Bassy's selection

## Sol Seppy - Slo Fuzz

Aleesha Dibbs: **"**Sol Seppy is a recent discovery for me - I was completely captured on first listen. On her track 'Slo Fuzz' in particular her production and ethereal vocals literally melted me. I initially heard it while walking down a really beautiful, deserted beach on the Central Coast in Australia on sunset. There's always a mystical pocket on dusk when the clouds reflect on a silky shoreline so you're kind of walking on air... the euphoric lift in the chorus was poignant at this moment.**"**

## David Bowie - Black Star

Blick Bassy: **"**This song takes me back to my childhood. For me, it's one of the most beautiful tracks of Cameroonian music. This artist has inspired a large part of my generation. When listening, you can sometimes hear the Cameroonian influence of Michael Jackson.**"**

## Laura Jean - A Funny Thing Happened 

Blick Bassy: **"**This song played on repeat in my small room in Yaounde, when I started singing. During school singing contests, I sometimes imagined myself as Jean Philippe Martely, a group that made me want to pursue this profession. Kassav.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Blick Bassy - LoBa

ImaCrea: **"**Blick Bassy's new album, Mádibá, is a true celebration of life. I especially love this track for its fusion of electro with the rich musical roots of the Baasa language in Cameroon, creating a spiritually uplifting blend that achieves a perfect balance and exquisite harmony. You can immediately sense the maturity of a great artist and the characteristic electro touch from Infiné. It's a must-listen on these sunny days of the new season, preferably while riding your bike.**"**

## FBC & VHOOR - Quando O DJ Toca

ImaCrea: **"**Here's an instant banger for you. Movement is what breathes life into our bodies. Let's dance and let the rhythm carry us away. Those are the moments I cherish, when I stumble upon a track online, and I can already tell it's going to stay in my vibe for days and days...**"**

## Nyami Nyami - Oceanic Sands

ImaCrea: **"**Stepping away from FBC & VHOOR's dancefloor, Nyami Nyami's 'Oceanic Sands' hits you like a musical tidal wave. It's a wild ride from one extreme to another, but damn, it's worth every moment of the switch-up.**"**

## Beverly Glenn-Copeland - People of the Loon

ImaCrea: **"**Returning to a spiritual atmosphere with the legendary artist Beverly Glenn-Copeland, we delve into a reflection on our ways of existence, in line with the concept of 'adjusted regards' coined by philosopher Baptiste Morizot.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today! Thank you for joining us; let's keep the good vibes flowing.
