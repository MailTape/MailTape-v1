<p id="introduction"> This morning,</p>

# Jacques' poem selection of the day: 

_If— by Rudyard Kipling_

If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you.<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting.<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>

If you can dream —and not make dreams your master<br>
If you can think —and not make thoughts your aim<br>
If you can meet Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,<br>
And stoop and build’em up with worn-out tools:<br>

If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”<br>

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
Or walk with Kings —nor lose the common touch,<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute,<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run.<br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
And —which is more— you’ll be a Man, my son! 

# **Jacques' selection**

+ ## Meredith Petronio - Flux Bis
_Jacques_: **"**Played loudly, this song, filled with silence, awakens me to full consciousness as I imagine my day as perfect as if it were the last.**"**

+ ## Lubomyr Melnyk – The Six Day Moment
_Jacques_: **"**Finally standing, the exterior world attempts to push me away from my perfect day, as I listen to this song and all its unpredictable harmonious changes, I accept them and include them in my perfect day.**"**

+ ## Oklou - Chrysalis 
_Jacques_: **"**Do not shy away from hitting the repeat button on this life saving song pulsating a rather harmful chorus, offering a last training exercise to activate your psychological neurons. For me, it evokes the thunderous ocean-like feeling of betrayal as you might start to mistrust your entourage. The cyclical expiry of an instant’s harmony, as if suddenly losing, in the midst of a verbal exchange, the primal desire to speak, the disturbance on a people’s face having just witnessed a fatal error while wandering the streets ‘’ We had planned to demolish this block of flats, but we never thought it would collapse that way. Nothing ever happens as intended, but in the end, everything seems acceptable.**"**

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## Jacques - L'Incroyable Vie des Choses
_Louise_: **"****"**

+ ## Romare - Je T'aime
_Louise_: **"** Funny enough, I discovered that song while living on a boat. Tides is an incredibly touching song, a pulsating yet passive symphony.**"**

+ ## Pavane - Pelléas
_Louise_: **"** I listened to this song during my morning run, right at the peak of flow, it's uplifting and simple yet vibrates something so magical.**"**

+ ## Segilola - Hurry Along
_Louise_: **"** The heat of the sun blasting through the speakers, this beat is wicked and chill . **"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for listening, thanks to **Jacques** for being or guest and a sound poet. Hope you enjoyed this tape!</p>
