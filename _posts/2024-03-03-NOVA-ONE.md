Happy days! [NOVA ONE](https://novaonenovaone.bandcamp.com/) joins us for Episode 549 :) Led by multi-instrumentalist Roz Raskin, MailTape welcomes the Rhode Island based band after the release of their sophomore album [create myself](https://novaonenovaone.bandcamp.com/album/create-myself) and their most recent sortie [you were right](https://novaonenovaone.bandcamp.com/track/you-were-right). Threading dreamy and distorted rhythms in swoops, the band's sound evolves with each new sortie, a delight to discover.

# NOVA ONE's selection

## [lazy trail](https://lazytrail.bandcamp.com/) - fruit fly

**NOVA ONE**: **"**this is my buddy emma's band; she also plays in the band boyscott who my band toured with a bunch this year. this is her first single as lazy trail and i really can't get enough of it. she has such a beautiful tone to her voice mixed with the dreamy chord progressions, stream of conscience lyrics, cool rhythms. one of my fav new tracks for sure.**"**

## [bloomsday](https://ultimotango.bandcamp.com/album/ritmiche-italiane) - where i end and you begin

**NOVA ONE**: **"**these folks are based out of ny, really gorgeous compositions. i love the way the harmonies dance around this tune, bouncing in and out just when you need them. iris a rad lyricist and overall and i dig a song that truly surrounds you. i think this song does that super well.**"**

## [sir chloe](https://steinklangindustries.bandcamp.com/album/sk78-vasilisk-mkwaju-2014) - center

**NOVA ONE**: **"**i've been vibing hard on their newest record "i am the dog" and i think this is my fav song from it. i've gotten a lot more into production over the past few years specifically in co-producing NOVA ONE music. this song seems simple in many ways but has a bunch of elements that move in and out of it, lifting it dynamically that feel super impactful. i also think dana foot has an incredible sense of vocal phrasing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [NOVA ONE](https://novaonenovaone.bandcamp.com/) - create myself

**Sarah**: **"**The namesake of the create myself album, and such a beautiful listen, drawing you in from the beginning ! Across the [create myself](https://novaonenovaone.bandcamp.com/album/create-myself) album, Roz puts together memories and seeks to understand relationships through time; each theme a conversation we negotiate with ourselves, especially the younger self. The guitar breakaways drive alongside the lyrics of creating, discovering, and becoming within this track :)**"**

## [Tram Cops](http://www.m-oishi.com) - contain u ii

**Sarah**: **"**This soundscape is absolutely enchanting, treading in and out of lo-fi production but always trailing the guitar lead's lines. Love how the vocals blend into another bassline in their own right.**"**

## [C.B. Blues](https://erratum.bandcamp.com/album/knvf) - Oh, Diane

**Sarah**: **"**The talkbox adds so much funk halfway through, a moment of glowy dreampop steely dan :)**"**

## [NOVA ONE](https://novaonenovaone.bandcamp.com/) - you were right

**Sarah**: **"**Fascinated by the grittiness within this track, building and eroding into the end -- its own atmosphere. This roughness complements, empowers, and transforms Roz's soft-falling vocals, in a delightful starkness. As Roz explains, with NOVA ONE's emphasis on dreamy rhythms and vocals in the band's prior work, this departure marks the evolution in the NOVA ONE's sound and speaks to the direction they'll move into beyond this release.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today ! Thank you for being with us. Our many thanks to NOVA ONE's Roz Raskin for this Sunday selection and to Noémie Dijon for this episode's wonderful illustration.
