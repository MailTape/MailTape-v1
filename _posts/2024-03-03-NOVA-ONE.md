# NOVA ONE's selection

## [lazy trail](https://astridostermortensen.bandcamp.com/album/gro-mig-en-blomst) - fruit fly

**NOVA ONE**: **"**this is my buddy emma's band; she also plays in the band boyscott who my band toured with a bunch this year. this is her first single as lazy trail and i really can't get enough of it. she has such a beautiful tone to her voice mixed with the dreamy chord progressions, stream of conscience lyrics, cool rhythms. one of my fav new tracks for sure.**"**

## [bloomsday](https://ultimotango.bandcamp.com/album/ritmiche-italiane) - where i end and you begin

**NOVA ONE**: **"**these folks are based out of ny, really gorgeous compositions. i love the way the harmonies dance around this tune, bouncing in and out just when you need them. iris a rad lyricist and overall and i dig a song that truly surrounds you. i think this song does that super well.**"**

## [sir chloe](https://steinklangindustries.bandcamp.com/album/sk78-vasilisk-mkwaju-2014) - center

**NOVA ONE**: **"**i've been vibing hard on their newest record "i am the dog" and i think this is my fav song from it. i've gotten a lot more into production over the past few years specifically in co-producing NOVA ONE music. this song seems simple in many ways but has a bunch of elements that move in and out of it, lifting it dynamically that feel super impactful. i also think dana foot has an incredible sense of vocal phrasing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [NOVA ONE](https://amidahrecords.bandcamp.com/album/deliveTongue) - In Orbit

**Sarah**: **"**This track comes from their latest album, [Deliverance And Spiritual Warfare](https://amidahrecords.bandcamp.com/album/delivWarfare). I find it very hypnotic. I love how each of their albums is a new page and explores different musical landscapes in a unique way. This one is particularly introspective, able to trigger moments of revelation and vivid visualization. Their generosity and passion can be clearly heard, and I highly recommend seeing them live if you have the opportunity.**"**

## [Masanori Oishi](http://www.m-oishi.com) - Tatatata Duo

**Sarah**: **"**It's been a while since I was waiting for the right moment to delve into this album. Having Holy Tongue as our guest and listening to their selection, I felt the moment was perfect for it. What a ride, very intense. This track comes from his album [No Man's 
Land](https://tower.jp/item/3879763/NO-MAN'S-LAND-MasanLand), where he plays JacobTV's tracks. I picked this one for its progressive build-up and cathartic explosion.**"**

## [Charmaine Lee](https://erratum.bandcamp.com/album/knvf) - False Gravity

**Sarah**: **"**I discovered Charmaine Lee's music as I was exploring latest releases by french label [Erratum Musical](https://erratum.bandcamp.com/). Her amazing experimental composition, and true mastery of the ability of human voice.**"**

## [Chafouin](https://chafouin.bandcamp.com/album/trois-quatre) - En mode Glass

**Sarah**: **"**I listened a lot to their album [In C](https://chafouin.bandcamp.com/album/in-c-3) where they play Terry Riley recently. And in the context of curating this episode, I discovered their latest album, [Trois, quatre](https://chafouin.bandcamp.com/album/trois-quatre). This track melting together vibes from contemporary music and progressive rock is a masterpiece.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for being with us. **If you plan to be in Paris on march the 29th, book your evening... More info very very soon, watch your emails!** A thousand thanks for Valentina, Allen and Susumu from Holy Tongue.
