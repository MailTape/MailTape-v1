# NOVA ONE's selection

## [lazy trail](https://astridostermortensen.bandcamp.com/album/gro-mig-en-blomst) - fruit fly

**NOVA ONE**: **"**this is my buddy emma's band; she also plays in the band boyscott who my band toured with a bunch this year. this is her first single as lazy trail and i really can't get enough of it. she has such a beautiful tone to her voice mixed with the dreamy chord progressions, stream of conscience lyrics, cool rhythms. one of my fav new tracks for sure.**"**

## [bloomsday](https://ultimotango.bandcamp.com/album/ritmiche-italiane) - where i end and you begin

**NOVA ONE**: **"**these folks are based out of ny, really gorgeous compositions. i love the way the harmonies dance around this tune, bouncing in and out just when you need them. iris a rad lyricist and overall and i dig a song that truly surrounds you. i think this song does that super well.**"**

## [sir chloe](https://steinklangindustries.bandcamp.com/album/sk78-vasilisk-mkwaju-2014) - center

**NOVA ONE**: **"**i've been vibing hard on their newest record "i am the dog" and i think this is my fav song from it. i've gotten a lot more into production over the past few years specifically in co-producing NOVA ONE music. this song seems simple in many ways but has a bunch of elements that move in and out of it, lifting it dynamically that feel super impactful. i also think dana foot has an incredible sense of vocal phrasing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [NOVA ONE](https://amidahrecords.bandcamp.com/album/deliveTongue) - create myself

**Sarah**: **"**putting together memories, relationships through time; each of these as a conversation we negotiate with ourselves, especially our younger selves. at times the track comforts this smaller version of self, at times yearning for it. as always the melodies and lyrics are central in roz's writing, and drive the tone of creating/discovering/becoming in this track. **"**

## [Tram Cops](http://www.m-oishi.com) - contain u ii

**Sarah**: **"**It's been a while since I was waiting for the right moment to delve into this album. Having Holy Tongue as our guest and listening to their selection, I felt the moment was perfect for it. What a ride, very intense. This track comes from his album [No Man's 
Land](https://tower.jp/item/3879763/NO-MAN'S-LAND-MasanLand), where he plays JacobTV's tracks. I picked this one for its progressive build-up and cathartic explosion.**"**

## [C.B. Blues](https://erratum.bandcamp.com/album/knvf) - Oh, Diane

**Sarah**: **"**The talkbox is so much fun halfway through, a moment of glowy dreampop steely dan :) Wish I had one of those things to phone people up with.**"**

## [NOVA ONE](https://chafouin.bandcamp.com/album/trois-quatre) - you were right

**Sarah**: **"**super interested in the grittiness within this track. as roz explains, with NOVA ONE's **"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for being with us. **If you plan to be in Paris on march the 29th, book your evening... More info very very soon, watch your emails!** A thousand thanks for Valentina, Allen and Susumu from Holy Tongue.
