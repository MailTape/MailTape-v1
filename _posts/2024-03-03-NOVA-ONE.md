# NOVA ONE's selection

## [lazy trail](https://astridostermortensen.bandcamp.com/album/gro-mig-en-blomst) - fruit fly

**NOVA ONE**: **"**this is my buddy emma's band; she also plays in the band boyscott who my band toured with a bunch this year. this is her first single as lazy trail and i really can't get enough of it. she has such a beautiful tone to her voice mixed with the dreamy chord progressions, stream of conscience lyrics, cool rhythms. one of my fav new tracks for sure.**"**

## [bloomsday](https://ultimotango.bandcamp.com/album/ritmiche-italiane) - where i end and you begin

**NOVA ONE**: **"**these folks are based out of ny, really gorgeous compositions. i love the way the harmonies dance around this tune, bouncing in and out just when you need them. iris a rad lyricist and overall and i dig a song that truly surrounds you. i think this song does that super well.**"**

## [sir chloe](https://steinklangindustries.bandcamp.com/album/sk78-vasilisk-mkwaju-2014) - center

**NOVA ONE**: **"**i've been vibing hard on their newest record "i am the dog" and i think this is my fav song from it. i've gotten a lot more into production over the past few years specifically in co-producing NOVA ONE music. this song seems simple in many ways but has a bunch of elements that move in and out of it, lifting it dynamically that feel super impactful. i also think dana foot has an incredible sense of vocal phrasing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [NOVA ONE](https://amidahrecords.bandcamp.com/album/deliveTongue) - create myself

**Sarah**: **"**The namesake of the create myself album, and such a beautiful track ! As always the melodies and lyrics are central in roz's writing, and drive the tone of creating/discovering/becoming in this track. roz speaks of putting together memories, relationships through time; each of these as a conversation we negotiate with ourselves, especially our younger selves. at times the track comforts this smaller version of self, at times yearning for it. the guitar breakaway is fantastic**"**

## [Tram Cops](http://www.m-oishi.com) - contain u ii

**Sarah**: **"**this soundscape is absolutely enchanting, treading in and out of lo-fi production but always falling along with the guitar leads. love how the vocals blend into another bassline.**"**

## [C.B. Blues](https://erratum.bandcamp.com/album/knvf) - Oh, Diane

**Sarah**: **"**The talkbox adds so much funk halfway through, a moment of glowy dreampop steely dan :) Would be so good to have one of those things to phone people up with.**"**

## [NOVA ONE](https://chafouin.bandcamp.com/album/trois-quatre) - you were right

**Sarah**: **"**fascinated by the grittiness mastered in this track, especially against roz's soft-falling vocals. as roz explains, with NOVA ONE's **"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for being with us. **If you plan to be in Paris on march the 29th, book your evening... More info very very soon, watch your emails!** A thousand thanks for Valentina, Allen and Susumu from Holy Tongue. Lots of gratitude to [Patricia](https://www.instagram.com/olharesfuturos/) for her catchy illustration. Until next Sunday, stay tuned.</p>
