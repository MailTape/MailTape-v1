This Morning, [Jesper Ryom](https://www.facebook.com/jesperryommusic "Jesper Ryom's Facebook") inspired us a mostly vibrant MailTape which we hope will help you enjoy your sunday morning. His selection is a combination of hidden indie jewels and a bit of heavy Berlin music. We've spiced it up with some bliss tracks. Enjoy!</p>

# A electronic tinkerer with real performer chops

I had the chance to discover Jesper Ryom through one of our previous guest [Port Rouge](http://mailta.pe/132/Port-Rouge/). Immediatly after my very first listen, I got hypnotised. What I really like in his music is its progressive and changing special touch. His debut EP is simply amazing. I highly recommand its purchase on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/album/syvsover-ep/id645445493 "buy now!").

# His morning selection

## Your Friend - Tame One
Jesper Ryom: **"**Your Friend released her debut EP on one of my favorite labels, Domino, in the beginning of April. This single from the EP is beautifully balanced song-writing. Love her voice, the lyrics and lofi-ishness of the recording. Especially the drums.**"**

## The War on Drugs - Red Eyes
Jesper Ryom: **"**I guess everybody’s heard this already, but I don’t care - you should listen to it again. It’s amazing.**"**

## Fort Romeau - Her Dream
Jesper Ryom: **"**Fort Romeau is such a great producer - only drops quality tunes. This one from his latest EP is no exception. Love the semi-crooked beat and that looming bass line is super cool as well.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to [Jesper Ryom](https://www.facebook.com/jesperryommusic "Jesper Ryom's Facebook") for his selection. Thanks and enjoy your sunday!
