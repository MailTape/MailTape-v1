<p id="introduction">This morning take a trip into the joyful and psychedelic world of Amarillo. Where all cultures and all landscapes are gathered. Where inspiration came from everywhere. Where the night is sunniest than the day. Where rhythms controls you. In short, the perfect summer sound. </p>
 
# Hear the World

Prick up one’s ear, did you recognize all influences of Amarillo ? I’ve found sounds of all the five continents in there first EP. Mostly from South America but there some asian vibes in it. Some will say that it looks like a soundtrack of a psychedelic Sergio Leon's western in which gallop David Bowie… This is somewhat true ! Bring up some African and polynesian’s riffs of guitar, and you’ve got all the five continents gathered.   
 
# Amarillo's morning inspiration

## Gengahr - She's a Witch
_AMARILLO:_ **"**A great and rare pop discover, it smell summer, waves, suncream... One of my last crush.**"**
 
## Unknow Mortal Orchestra - Swim and Sleep
_AMARILLO:_ **"**How to say, this track is ... Wonderful ! A lacy writing amazingly mixed with a performance without any fuss, kind of brutal, it's rare and it give a surprising power to a track that seems so simple.**"**
 
## Chinawoman - Party Girl
_AMARILLO:_ **"**...and there, a little gloomy masterpiece, what a voice ! Perfect incarnation of the word "languid". As nostalgic as sensual.**"**
