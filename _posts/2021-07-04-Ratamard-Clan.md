<p id="introduction">This morning,we are tired, exhausted and washed away by this complicated year but finally ready for his much-deserved great holiday. It is with the joy of the world before that we will spend this Sunday with the Ratamard Clan group. 
The Ratamard Clan, as he describes himself so well, is “a rare kind of master of ceremonies whose peculiarity is to show an overflowing enthusiasm. ” A programme that lays the groundwork and makes you want! A particular style: “Bohémian -rap-sordid”, enough to leave you speechless!

# Ratamard Clan's selection

## Bando – Wesh Gros
Ratamard Clan:**"**From the very first hour on Sunday, it’s very important to give your motherf*****.**"**

## Pierre Perret  – Café du Canal
Ratamard Clan:**"**After having fucked her motherf***** we all meet at the cafe du canal at the pretty Rosette.**"**

## Meryl  – BB Compte
Ratamard Clan: **"**And then obviously life and time take back their rights, you have to think about going home but first, you have to pay the bill.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Ratamard Clan – Nouveau Monde
Anaïs G: **"**With their rap half-provocative, half-comedy, this quartet made in Ariège leads us to rethink the world in their title “Nouveau Monde. ” A title on the Poupou record Mixtape Vol. 1. With real message behind as on ecology or feminism, how not liked the Ratamard Clan?**"**

## Kt Gorique – Brienne
Anaïs G: **"**Discovered during the Block Party Festival in Foix, I was seduced by its flow, its a way of being, and especially its commitment to important subjects such as the place of women in rap today and others. An incredible power of speech that leaves us speechless!**"**

## Farlot - Plavon
Anaïs G: **"**Rapper made in Limoges, Farlot has established himself with his uncontaminated and laid-back style. Sweeping rhymes and fresh sounds, everything you love to spend a light summer.**"**

## Lombre – Espoir Noir
Anaïs G: **"**It was while going to the Cabadzi-Blier concert that I was able to see Lombre in the opening act. An intimate moment, with a guitarist and him. Acoustics to give power to words. His musical style is hard to define. It brings together both the poetic side and the spoken word, as well as rap and pop. A wide spectrum and a sensitivity that makes us slip from the first words sung.**"** 

<p id="outroduction"> That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for listening with us. So much love to Ratamard Clan for the delightful Sunday selections and to Noèmie Dijon for this episode's brilliant illustration </p>
