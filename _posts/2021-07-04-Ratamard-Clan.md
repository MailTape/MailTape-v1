# MailTape's selection

## [Misha Panfilov](https://mpsc.bandcamp.com/) – Horizon
Sarah: **"**Misha's latest release and prelude to arriving releases under Misha Panfilov Sound Combo. Cosmonaut cowboy in a mosaic of sound texturing, effortless. The lap steel guitar gives such a folk grounding to the song's otherwise cosmic orchestral energy. I love the guitar solos that take the forefront at the song's end. **"**

## [Misha Panfilov](https://mpsc.bandcamp.com/), [Shawn Lee](https://shawnleeubiq.bandcamp.com/) – Belt Buckle
Sarah: **"**This track arrives off of the 2020 album Paradise Cove, a brilliant Misha Panfilov and Shawn Lee collaboration. The influence of Soviet-era cinematic music is especially apparent, but engaging with tones of funk and punk in this revist. What an exciting time for fusion music.**"**

## [Thijsenterprise](https://thijsenterprise.bandcamp.com/) – YYY
Sarah: **"**Off of Reinier Thijs's latest 2021 album, Driehuizen, which is a very fitting sequel to Lahringen. Reinier continues to take admirable and unpredictable risks in his improvisation. Love the vocal accents (screams?). Such a refreshing concept for a jazz album.**"**

## [Paul Higgs](https://cosmovvisiones.bandcamp.com/), [Chico Bernardes](https://chicobernardes.bandcamp.com/) – Tramo Trompa
Sarah: **"**Love this Paul Higgs and Chico Bernardes colaboration! Such an engaging meld of folk guitar undertones, psychpop reworks, and punk accents. The audio blending and building distortion were unexpected but very appreciated :)**"** 

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you for taking the time to listen. It was a joy and pleasure to welcome [Misha Panfilov](https://mpsc.bandcamp.com/) for this engaging Sunday selection. Great thanks to [Jason Pridham](https://www.instagram.com/grancharismo/?hl=en) for this episode's vibrant illustration.
