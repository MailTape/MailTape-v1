# Okala's selection

##  Shorebilly - We care about you boy
Okala: **"**We care about you boy by Shorebilly is one of my favorite track ever, it makes me feel so good. I had the chance to play keyboards on stage with Shorebilly (Rémi Alexandre, already known for being a part of the band Syd Matters) and we’ve worked together on my debut EP. It’s such a huge pleasure to love a song written and performed by a friend that much, a very creative and talented artist.**"**

##  Charlotte Adigéry - Paténipat
Okala: **"**I had a real musical crush on Charlotte Adigéry, especially on this song which is full of a hypnotic energy that blows my mind. Amazing artist ! Charlotte Adigéry is dope. Very good to wake up to and have a good day!**"**

##  Broken Social Scene - Meet Me in The basement
Okala: **"**You know I feel extremely concerned about world’s issues but sometimes it can be depressing on a rainy cold sunday in winter… But each time I put this song on, it makes me feel brave enough to face a new day in a world I don’t really understand. I think Broken Social Scene could have named this song « Heal the world » but obviously, this title was already taken…**"**
