<p id="introduction">This Morning, we board to a new year full of joy and love...  but mainly full of music discoveries and hearing gems! This trip, with Cam Maclean as our Captain, promises to be filed of hope and sweetness to spend a good sunday.  
[Cam MacLean](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/cammacleanband/) is born in Montreal and he's one of the Vesuvio Solo's two members. In love with melancholic indie-pop music, I was enthralled by this songwriter's ballads —sometimes under the infuence of the 80's.</p>


# Cam Maclean's selection

## Cadence Weapon - Five Roses feat Blue Hawaii
_Cam Maclean_: **"**This song by my friend [Cadence Weapon](http://www.cadenceweaponmusic.com/) is the most mellow track from the self-titled record he released this year, and great for Sunday morning listening. It is, among other things, a tribute to other artists like him who are originally from Alberta but who became integral parts of the music scene in Montreal. It features a stunning vocal performance by Raphaelle from [Blue Hawaii](https://bluehawaii.bandcamp.com/) (herself an Alberta expat in Montreal). My own Montreal neighbourhood of Outremont is also referenced here.**"**

## Jessica Pratt - Moon Dude
_Cam Maclean_: **"**I've always been into folk and acoustic music that's eccentric in terms of production and performance, and in particular that is centred around a strange or unique vocal. I think [Jessica Pratt](https://twitter.com/jessicaprattsf?lang=fr) is of the tradition of singers like John Jacob Niles and Karen Dalton whose unique voices helped expand simple acoustic songs far beyond their cores. Moon Dude really showcases the unique timbre of J.P.'s voice, as well as her strange delivery.**"**

## Bonny Doon - I am Here (I am alive)
_Cam Maclean_: **"**I have been into this band since sharing the stage with them in Detroit in 2015 when I was touring with [Vesuvio Solo](https://vesuviosolo.bandcamp.com/). This song has a kind of nihilistic resignation, but with a certain humour I like that comes through in lines like, "smoke from palo santo and sage, is this the new age or am I too late?" I have been on an alt-country kick lately, and this one has been on repeat for the past while.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Cam Maclean - Sunshine 
_Anaïs G_: **"**When I first listen to the new record "Wait for Love", I was pleasantly surprised by [Cam Maclean's](https://atelierciseaux.bandcamp.com/album/cam-maclean-wait-for-love) voice. This entire song still my lightly track for nightmarish days.**"**


## Belmont Witch - Romperlo 
_Anaïs G_: **"**Experimental pop, intimate vibes, social claims... everything is here to revive memories of adolescence with this mystic Parisian band, leaded by the young Mexican Michèle.**"**


## Westerman - Outside Sublime
_Anaïs G_: **"**There are songs that you can't do without and that you can listen to infinite without being sick of. It's like if this young Londoner understood everything by making something flamboyant and warm from his own pop music.**"**


## Connan Mockasin - Momo's feat James Blake
 _Anaïs G_: **"**A great final with two talentuous artists: Connan Mockasin's madness merged with James Blake' sweetness. A startling mix that works from the first seconds and get me drunk of tenderness.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's all folks, thanks for listening ! A special thanks to Cam Maclean for being our guest this morning and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's gorgeous illustration. Have a sweet Sunday !</p>
