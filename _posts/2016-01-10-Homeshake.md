Story about music and Homeshake

# Homeshake's inspiring selection :
 
## Jerry Paper - 3D Dream
Homeshake: **"**The universe is a hologram, but today you can get out of bed and make it work for you with help from Jerry Paper, what a great guy!**"**

## Unblonde - Look
Degiheugi:**"**Unblonde's album "water the next day" is a good soundtrack to the glass of water you poured yourself last night and woke up next to, stale, and with all that dust on the top**"**

## Tonstartssbandht - Hymn Eola
Degiheugi: **"**There is a god, and she is beautiful and gives life to song through the voices of two brothers named Andy and Edwin**“**
