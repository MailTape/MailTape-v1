<p id="introduction">Welcome back to a new season of MailTape! This morning we welcome Chicago-based woozy noodler [Beau Wanzer](https://beauwanzer.bandcamp.com/) to select three contorted Sunday morning tunes with us. 
<br><br>
A molecular biologist who has a fluency with machines, Beau Wanzer brings the experimentation from his day job to his music with innovative experiments, splicing, and twisted knob-twiddling.

# Beau Wanzer's selection

## Brannten Schnüre – Licht
Beau Wanzer: **"**Sunday mornings tend to be different on a weekly basis depending on what hijinx I was getting into the previous night. For the most part, I prefer tracks that are soothing and easy on my mushy partially functioning brain. I discovered Brannten Schnüre earlier this year and have been obsessed with all of their output. It reminds me a lot of 'A Moon Lay Hidden Beneath The Cloud' (if not familiar...I suggest looking them up). [Brannten Schnüre](https://soundcloud.com/branntenschnuere) is a great mix of dark ambient, folk, and just the right amount of weirdness to keep me intrigued. Their music is beautiful and otherworldly.**"**

## Die Todliche Doris – Die Uber Doris (ft. David Steeves—English Version)
Beau Wanzer: **"**My obsession with [Die Todliche Doris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_T%C3%B6dliche_Doris) has been a struggle throughout the years....mostly on my limited disposable income. One of the main reasons for my Die Todliche Doris infatuation is the diversity of their output, both visually and sonically. They embody this thick line between art school punk weirdos, noisy nonsense noodlings, and soothing shenanigans. I picked up this record in 2006 at a record store here in Chicago. There are two different versions of this track...one in English and the other in German. I love both, but picked the English version. I chose this track because it's something that I can put on while taking care of my Sunday morning ritual of chugging coffee and eating chicken embryos. It's a great track to zone out too.**"**

## [Thorax-Wach](https://www.discogs.com/artist/276715-Thorax-Wach) – Ruhe Im Karton
Beau Wanzer: **"**This album came into a record store I used to work at in my early 20's. I knew nothing about it, but the cover intrigued me, so I threw it on. To my pleasant surprise it revolved around one thing I love....nut job synths. These two wackadoodles resided in Göttingen in the early 80's and made music using only two MS20's and a microphone. I love the minimal playfulness of it. It's both soothing and humorous. It also includes a really nice finger snap. I usually stumble around my apartment with a coffee in one hand while the other snaps to the beat....kinda like those guys you see hanging in dark alleys right before they bust into some terrible musical number. I hate musicals.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Beau Wanzer – Snake and Shake
Sanjay: **"**Širom’s music is a surrealist romp, mixing minimalism and Balkan folk in a way that appears to warp, warble and waver. Evoking images of twilight dances around a fire, this track teases with harmonies carefully emerging from the droning dirge created by an impressive range of instruments from each member of the trio.**"**

## Klein – Claim It
Sanjay: **"**Recurring riffs maintain the steady pulse throughout this album, while wandering freely around the swales between genres. This track brings the buzuk into the foreground of a solitary landscape, as [Radwan Ghazi Moumneh](https://www.jerusaleminmyheart.com/) applies effects to alter its timbral characteristics.**"**

## ELLLL – HOT WHEELS
Sanjay: **"**[75 Dollar Bill](https://75-dollar-bill.bandcamp.com/) are New York duo Rick Brown and Che Chen. Their sound feels impossible to place or summarise—not unlike the city they compose in. Circular riffs, harmonium-like drones, and a deft application of different kinds of harmonic distortion give this track (and album) a brilliant palette to dip in and out of.**"**

## Xao Seffcheque & Der Rest – Ja-Nein-Vielleicht
Sanjay: **"**This is from chapter four of Matana's Coin Coin project, combining written scores, improvisation, storytelling and performative theatre. This latest installment comes with backing from a new band, contributing to the already intricate weave of the previous three chapters. "Life goes on for as long as it lasts. We’ll roll the old chariot along, and we’ll all hang on behind."**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [Širom](http://siromband.si/) for their Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
