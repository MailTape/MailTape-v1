# My Summer Bee and her delicious honey.

Instant positive feeling, that's what I experienced when I discovered [My Summer Bee](https://www.facebook.com/pages/My-Summer-Bee/149662595048885). Apparently this little bee knows where to find the best flowers to produce a rich and sunny honey full of positive waves. Definitely something we all need during the winter. Coming from one of the most prolific french city at the moment, Caen, these 5 talents made a great decision by leaving their hive and deciding to share their vibe with the world.

# ere's the nectar she wanted to share.

+ ## Brenton Wood - Gimme Little Sign
_Deluxe_: **"**It dates from 1967, but we have discovered this song very recently. It's soul music, no doubt about it. Very good soul music. But moreover, at our opinion, this is a wonderful pop song. Perfect to warm up us as the winter season opens.**"**

+ ## Metronomy - Everything Goes My Way
_Deluxe_: **"**We have very often listen to this song during the first months of existence of My Summer Bee. It was for us the perfect example of what a good song must be. It sounds fresh and simple, but always full of surprises. And what a sound! So clear and lively.**"**

+ ## The Child of Love - Fly
_Deluxe_: **"**One of our favorite discovery of this year. An incredible mix of pop, soul, funk, electro and hip-hop music. Cole Williams, the man behind The Child Of Lov, may well be a tall skinny Dutchman, his voice is deep and definitely black.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's all folks ! Dance, live, enjoy !</p>
