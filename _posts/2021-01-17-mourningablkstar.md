# Mourning [A] BLKstar's selection

## Kokoroko - Ti-de
Theresa May (Trumpet) of Mourning [A] BLKstar: **"**Sunday mornings in my household are the most chill and reserved for staying in bathrobes all day. After sleeping in, my boyfriend and I have freshly ground coffee and a late brunch before slowly diving into our to-do lists.

The perfect soundtrack for a chill yet productive Sunday undoubtedly includes Ti-de by Kokoroko. The groove starts with all the essentials; bass, percussion/drums, keys, and ethereal guitar, followed by the hypnotic melody presented by the horn section. Nearing the end of the song we are then treated with calming vocals, after which I hit the repeat button.

This tune is on their 2019 album release titled “Kokoroko” and is about 6 minutes of pure magic.**"**

## Pablo Amor - whutitseemz
RA Washington (electronics) of Mourning [A] BLKstar: **"**The entire record bangs, the beats and the lyrics are completely fire. We bump this at the blk sonix lab all the time, hidden gem of last year**"**

## Beverly Glenn-Copeland - Winter Astral
Pete Saudek (guitar & keys) of Mourning [A] BLKstar: **"**This song creates a portal to a space of openness, makes me feel like I’m floating through a dark, beautiful skyline of sorts.

The swirling synth tones grounded by the bending organ-like bass while changing keys and all makes it feel like an infinite exploration or something, carrying me through weird wintry nights.

This whole album, “Keyboard Fantasies,” pushes me to free the sounds I try to control and let my environment flow through me when I sit down to write.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Mourning [A] BLKstar - Be
ImaCrea: **"**I can't remember how many times I played their album since I discovered it. Was definitely not easy to choose which track to choose. I think I finally selected this one because it's the one I needed most today, there's something so deep with her voice. Something real and present. Something that not a single electronic machine (and you know how much I love electronic music) can't bring and that is needed more than ever in these times. Months without being able to go see a liveshow but today, with this track, I almost felt they were here playing in my living room and it felt so warm... even though it was snowing outside.**"**

## Monomono - The World Might Fall Over
ImaCrea: **"**Back to the 70's in Nigeria. One beautiful gem from afropop movement combined with progressive rock vibes. 50 years later, the vibe is still here and my guts can very well feel it. One doesn't need a time machine when we have art.**"**

## SAULT - Bow feat Michael Kiwanuka 
ImaCrea: **"**Back to today with this protest song, the combat is not finished yet. In fact, we need to stay alert and keep pushing more than ever. It's about time to make fascists affraid again. We got rights!**"**

## Chanel Tres - unfinished business 
ImaCrea: **"**And you know what's the best weapon? Love and fearless dance moves! Move that body, let it shake far away all the tension locked down in your muscles and spine for the past months. Choose light, abandon darkness.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to the whole beautiful family of [Mourning [A] BLKstar] for their Sunday selection, and many thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's polaroidish illustration!</p>
