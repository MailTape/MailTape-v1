Ti-de by Kokoroko
Sunday mornings in my household are the most chill and reserved for staying in bathrobes all day. After sleeping in, my boyfriend and I have freshly ground coffee and a late brunch before slowly diving into our to-do lists. The perfect soundtrack for a chill yet productive Sunday undoubtedly includes Ti-de by Kokoroko. The groove starts with all the essentials; bass, percussion/drums, keys, and ethereal guitar, followed by the hypnotic melody presented by the horn section. Nearing the end of the song we are then treated with calming vocals, after which I hit the repeat button. This tune is on their 2019 album release titled “Kokoroko” and is about 6 minutes of pure magic. --Theresa May (Trumpet) of Mourning [A] BLKstar

 whutitseemz by Pablo Amor
The entire record bangs, the beats and the lyrics are completely fire. We bump this at the blk sonix lab all the time, hidden gem of last year --RA Washington (electronics) of Mourning [A] BLKstar

Winter Astral by Beverly Glenn-Copeland
This song creates a portal to a space of openness, makes me feel like I’m floating through a dark, beautiful skyline of sorts. The swirling synth tones grounded by the bending organ-like bass while changing keys and all makes it feel like an infinite exploration or something, carrying me through weird wintry nights. This whole album, “Keyboard Fantasies,” pushes me to free the sounds I try to control and let my environment flow through me when I sit down to write.  --Pete Saudek (guitar & keys) of Mourning [A] BLKstar

Go For A Ride - Jah Nada
A fun jam for bike riding or sitting by the lake or dancing in the kitchen. Jah Nada is a frequent collaborator with M[A]B and is the engineer for our latest album The Cycle. -- RA Washington of Mourning [A] BLKstar
