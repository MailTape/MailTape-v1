# Mourning [A] BLKstar's selection

## Kokoroko - Ti-de
Theresa May (Trumpet) of Mourning [A] BLKstar: **"**Sunday mornings in my household are the most chill and reserved for staying in bathrobes all day. After sleeping in, my boyfriend and I have freshly ground coffee and a late brunch before slowly diving into our to-do lists. The perfect soundtrack for a chill yet productive Sunday undoubtedly includes Ti-de by Kokoroko. The groove starts with all the essentials; bass, percussion/drums, keys, and ethereal guitar, followed by the hypnotic melody presented by the horn section. Nearing the end of the song we are then treated with calming vocals, after which I hit the repeat button. This tune is on their 2019 album release titled “Kokoroko” and is about 6 minutes of pure magic. --**"**

## Pablo Amor - whutitseemz
RA Washington (electronics) of Mourning [A] BLKstar: **"**The entire record bangs, the beats and the lyrics are completely fire. We bump this at the blk sonix lab all the time, hidden gem of last year**"**

## Beverly Glenn-Copeland - Winter Astral
Pete Saudek (guitar & keys) of Mourning [A] BLKstar: **"**This song creates a portal to a space of openness, makes me feel like I’m floating through a dark, beautiful skyline of sorts. The swirling synth tones grounded by the bending organ-like bass while changing keys and all makes it feel like an infinite exploration or something, carrying me through weird wintry nights. This whole album, “Keyboard Fantasies,” pushes me to free the sounds I try to control and let my environment flow through me when I sit down to write.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [DJ Lycox](https://www.facebook.com/dlycox/) - Solteiro
Jules: **"**Like for other PRÍNCIPE's producers, we find in Lycox's music his kuduro and kizomba influences, as well as these crazy and complex percussions which made me discover a new way of dancing, more physical. But beyond that, he stands out with its aerial and melancholic melodies that have something special and which make you want to escape too. And right now we absolutely need it.**"**

## Anz - Loos In Twos (NRG)
Jules: **"**With this track opening her last EP released last September, the Manchester-based DJ and producer [Anz](https://anzdj.bandcamp.com/) delivers a sequence of kicks and drums as well suited for the dancefloors as to liven up your morning exercise.**"**

## Azu Tiwaline - Terremer
Jules: **"**Let's calm down now, it's time to dive to the bottom of the ocean or, failing that, its bathtub. Here the percussions of the Tunisian producer [Azu Tiwaline](https://azutiwaline.bandcamp.com/) are slower and have a hypnotizing effect that takes us somewhere between the sea and the desert, between shadow and light.**"**

## Beatrice Dillon - Workaround Two
Jules: **"**Drums, more drums, always drums. Here the work of the UK-based rhythm-obsessive musician and DJ [Beatrice Dillon](https://beatricedillon.bandcamp.com/) perfectly combines with Laurel Halo's vocals as well as acoustic samples from a wide range of guests to embark you on an innovative trip.**"**
