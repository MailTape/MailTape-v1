<p id="introduction">
This morning, we unsheathe our heat wave plan too. French Kiwi Juice, aka FKJ. The French producer shares his inspirations. From Soul to Hip-Hop, as long as it grooves ! Flagship of the Roche Musique team, FKJ explode since 2 years now. Some International tours and two huge EPs to his credit, he's now the leader of the third revival of french electronic scene. 
</p>

# First of all multi-instrumentalist 
The force of FKJ is his complete musical experience. Bassist, pianist, guitarist, his perfomances live are breathtaking. FKJ is also in the tradition of producers looking for the perfect voices. Those that inspire him. Choices of Hiatus Kaiyote in his selection below is a good proof for his fascination for soulful voices. Be careful, this mailtape can't be listened below 30°C, and sound quality is better near the beach, now you know what to do.

## Hiatus Kaiyote - Fingerprints
French Kiwi Juice: **"**_The new Hiatus Kaiyote's album, "Choose your Weapon", is now on my toplist albums, a masterpiece. Soulful, innovative and daring while remaining very accessible. I often start my day with this track._**“**

## Phony Ppl - Why iii Love the Moon
FKJ: **"**_Phony Ppl is a nu-soul band, based in Brooklyn, that I follow closely these days. Feel good style, perfect for mornings._**"**

## Jeremih - Chillin 
FKJ: **"**_It does not seem to me that this track has been an official release, only available on a free Jeremih's mixtape in poor quality mp3. I find it so effective, all hooks are crazy, it makes me smile every time._**"**
