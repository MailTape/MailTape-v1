<p id="introduction">
This morning, you'll wake up with some Californian vibes thanks to our guest [B.Lewis](https://soundcloud.com/blewie17 "B.Lewis Soundcloud")</p>

# French inspiration ?

Back to 2010, B.Lewis caught our attention up with his EP [La Semaine](http://blewis.bandcamp.com/album/la-semaine "B.Lewis - La Semaine on Bandcamp"), 'week' in english: 7 days, 7 tracks with a perfect flow. Four years later and some very cool others [EPs](http://blewis.bandcamp.com/ "B.Lewis Bandcamp") after, we're very happy to let you discover the selection of this San Jose California based producer.
Hope you'll enjoy...

# His morning selection

## Taylor McFerrin – Decisions (feat. Emily King)
_B.Lewis:_ **"**I’ve been extremely stuck on this record since it came out. Atmospheric and cohesive, the melody easily carries you on generous morning music high.**"**

## Musiq Soulchild – Just Friends
_B.Lewis:_ **"**For me, this song is a classic, wake up and get your day started on the right foot type of track. The uplifting, teetering borderline gospel feel, is sometimes just what I need to get my days started.**"**

## Toro Y Moi - So Many Details
_B.Lewis:_ **"**One of the many favorites off of his album “Anything in Return”, curated by the masterful Toro Y Moi. Something moody I can nod my head to while brushing my teeth.**"**
