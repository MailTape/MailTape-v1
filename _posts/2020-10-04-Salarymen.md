## A New Post

<p id="introduction">We are delighted  to welcome [Salarymen](https://salarymen.bandcamp.com/) to host the first MailTape episode of October! Based in Sydney, Salarymen effortlessly blends retro influences into their music, never scraping on their own authentic sound. 
This morning, Salarymen brings us a dynamic selection sure to energize and refresh your Sunday morning. 

</p>

# Salarymen's selection

## [Weyes Blood](https://weyesblood.bandcamp.com/) - Andromeda
Salarymen: **"**Everything about this song is incredibly soothing - from the stunning vocals, to the whimsical guitars and the dreamy synths. It was actually produced by one of our other favourite artists, Foxygen. I can’t help but stop what I’m doing, and sing along to this track when it comes on. It’s beautifully reflective and well-written, and is the perfect soundtrack to a relaxing Sunday.**"**

## [The Lemon Twigs](https://thelemontwigs.bandcamp.com/) - Frank
Salarymen: **"**I have always wanted to write something about this song - it’s so eccentric, and delivers a real classic Frank Sinatra vibe. The creativity and musicianship is insane, with the whole song building up section by section. The intro sets the scene beautifully, and when the rhythm section come in at the 1:30 mark, I always get a rush of energy because its so damn good.**"** 

## [Whitney](https://whitneychicago.bandcamp.com/) - Golden Days
Salarymen: **"**This song has such beautiful instrumentation and a lovely sentiment to match - we could never get tired of listening to it. From the dreamy slide guitars to the brass section, it perfectly captures a sense of nostalgia and longing for a better time, always leaving a smile on our face.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Salarymen](https://salarymen.bandcamp.com/) – Runaway
Sarah: **"**The movement on this track is contagious, the piano flourish at the beginning is such a great introduction into the groove. The balance of male and female vocals that Salarymen play on is magical and dynamic. Their use of retro synths and analogs (which, according to the band, are so wonderful but so fragile) make for a distinct spirit in their recordnings. There's also a natural feel to this release that breaks camp from the overly poolished quality we hear in so much music tooday. Not only was this authenticity the goal of Salarymen, it's also part of their striking charm. Listening to the guitar at the end had me dancing around my bedroom, the energy here is absolutely captivating :)**"**

## [Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys](https://www.facebook.com/hiigenevieve/) – Make You Feel Blue
Sarah: **"**Salarymen introduced me to this song, and I've loved it for the past couple of months. Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys bring country influences to the Australian stage, infusing their music with vibrant, nostalgic energy.**"**

## [Laraaji](https://fengsuave.bandcamp.com/) – Laws of Manifestation
Sarah: **"**I listen to this song every morning.**"**

## [Chico Bernardes] – Me Encontrar
Sarah: **"**So much soul in this track but falling so gently, the power in this song snuck up on me. Chico Bernardes laces his swaying instrumentals with the most marked verses. I've been contemplating over "perdido, no mundo em que eu nasci," meaning I am lost in the world I was born in. Chico Bernardes builds such a lovely space of music to daydream within, perfect for your dreamy Sunday morning.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thank you so much for listening with us. Thank you to Mini Trees for her daydream selection, and to Julie Wo for this episode's fantastic illustration. Happy September!</p>
