<p id="introduction">We are delighted  to welcome [Salarymen](https://salarymen.bandcamp.com/) to host the first MailTape episode of October! Based in Sydney, Salarymen effortlessly blends retro influences into their music, never scraping on their own authentic sound. Salarymen brings to MailTape a dynamic selection sure to energize and refresh your Sunday morning.

# Salarymen's selection

## [Weyes Blood](https://weyesblood.bandcamp.com/) - Andromeda
Salarymen: **"**Everything about this song is incredibly soothing - from the stunning vocals, to the whimsical guitars and the dreamy synths. It was actually produced by one of our other favourite artists, Foxygen. I can’t help but stop what I’m doing, and sing along to this track when it comes on. It’s beautifully reflective and well-written, and is the perfect soundtrack to a relaxing Sunday.**"**

## [The Lemon Twigs](https://thelemontwigs.bandcamp.com/) - Frank
Salarymen: **"**I have always wanted to write something about this song - it’s so eccentric, and delivers a real classic Frank Sinatra vibe. The creativity and musicianship is insane, with the whole song building up section by section. The intro sets the scene beautifully, and when the rhythm section come in at the 1:30 mark, I always get a rush of energy because its so damn good.**"** 

## [Whitney](https://whitneychicago.bandcamp.com/) - Golden Days
Salarymen: **"**This song has such beautiful instrumentation and a lovely sentiment to match - we could never get tired of listening to it. From the dreamy slide guitars to the brass section, it perfectly captures a sense of nostalgia and longing for a better time, always leaving a smile on our face.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Salarymen](https://salarymen.bandcamp.com/) – Runaway
Sarah: **"**The piano flourish at Runaway's beginning is the perfect introduction into the vibrance of the track. The use of retro synths and analogs (which, according to the band, are "so wonderful but so fragile") shape Salarymen's distinctive recording spirit. There's a natural feel to this release that survived production, giving us Runaway's not-overly-polished groove. Not only was this authenticity the goal of Salarymen, it's also part of their striking charm. Listening to the guitar at the end had me dancing around my bedroom, the energy here is absolutely contagious :)**"**

## [Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys](https://caitlinharnett.bandcamp.com/music) – Make You Feel Blue
Sarah: **"**Salarymen introduced me to this song, and I've been in love with it for the past couple of months. Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys bring country influences to the Australian stage, with such playful and yet nostalgic flourish. The romantic imagery in the lyrics always makes me smile.**"**

## [Laraaji](https://laraajimusic.bandcamp.com/) – Laws of Manifestation
Sarah: **"**I listen to this song every morning, and I now know all the words, even the sequence of sounds at the end. Highly recommend learning them, as I am immediately put into a fantastic mood for the rest of the day with each listen. The celestial zira/mbira instrumentals in the background elevate the track into a walking daydream. The laws of manifestation really are on your side this fine Sunday :)**"**

## [Chico Bernardes](https://chicobernardes.bandcamp.com/album/chico-bernardes) – Me Encontrar
Sarah: **"**So much soul in this track but falling so gently, the power in this song snuck up on me. Brazilian folk artist Chico Bernardes laces his swaying instrumentals with the most marked verses. I've been contemplating over "perdido, no mundo em que eu nasci," meaning I am lost in the world I was born in. Chico Bernardes builds such a lovely and calming space of music to woolgather within, perfect for your Sunday morning.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thank you so much for listening with us :) Thank you to Salarymen for this electric selection, you were such a joy to welcome to MailTape! And of course, thank you to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's **gorgeous** illustration. Happy October !</p>
