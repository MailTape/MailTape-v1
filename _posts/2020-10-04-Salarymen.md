Salarymen

# Salarymen's selection

## [Weyes Blood](https://weyesblood.bandcamp.com/) - Andromeda
Salarymen: **"**Everything about this song is incredibly soothing - from the stunning vocals, to the whimsical guitars and the dreamy synths. It was actually produced by one of our other favourite artists, Foxygen. I can’t help but stop what I’m doing, and sing along to this track when it comes on. It’s beautifully reflective and well-written, and is the perfect soundtrack to a relaxing Sunday.**"**

## [The Lemon Twigs](https://thelemontwigs.bandcamp.com/) - Frank
Salarymen: **"**I have always wanted to write something about this song - it’s so eccentric, and delivers a real classic Frank Sinatra vibe. The creativity and musicianship is insane, with the whole song building up section by section. The intro sets the scene beautifully, and when the rhythm section come in at the 1:30 mark, I always get a rush of energy because its so damn good.**"** 

## [Whitney](https://whitneychicago.bandcamp.com/) - Golden Days
Salarymen: **"**This song has such beautiful instrumentation and a lovely sentiment to match - we could never get tired of listening to it. From the dreamy slide guitars to the brass section, it perfectly captures a sense of nostalgia and longing for a better time, always leaving a smile on our face.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Salarymen](https://salarymen.bandcamp.com/) – Runaway
Sarah: **"**This song!**"**

## [Genevieve Stokes](https://www.facebook.com/hiigenevieve/) – Lonely And Bored
Sarah: **"**This is a new release by Genevieve Stokes. The beauty of her collection hits you just as its sadness does. Through all of her harmonies and beautiful vocals, there's an angelic simplicity in Stokes' music that I didn't know I was craving. The wonderfully strange quality with songs like this is that you start to feel nostalgic for something you’ve never experienced. It’s over too soon, beautiful beautiful beautiful :)**"**

## [Feng Suave](https://fengsuave.bandcamp.com/) – Maybe Another Time
Sarah: **"**Dutch group Feng Suave blessed us with a new EP, Warping Youth, in June. This track is my favorite off of that collection. As always with Feng Suave, the mix starts off smooth as silk, and keeps up this mood. The song lives in an easy-going jazz groove while also having some 1960's surfer vibes. The tone reminds me of a anesthetic dream, it doesn't feel real but feels familiar at the same time. Side note: there's apparently real debate on whether or not one can actually dream under anesthesia, so maybe this simile is a bit controversial. I still like the way it sounds, so I'm not going to change it. We've never strayed away from being provocative at MailTape.**"**

## [Golden Daze](https://goldendaze.bandcamp.com/album/simpatico) – Lynard Bassman
Sarah: **"**This year, Golden Daze released the demos of their 2019 album, Simpatico. I rediscovered the tracks and fell in love with this one. The 70's psychedelic folk influences are a killer combination with the guitar leading us through the song's motions. I've been going for drives late at night and this has been on my playlist. It's nice in the dark, but I think it'll make a good fit for Sunday mornings, too.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thank you so much for listening with us. Thank you to Mini Trees for her daydream selection, and to Julie Wo for this episode's fantastic illustration. Happy September!</p>
