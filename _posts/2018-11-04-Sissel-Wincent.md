<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Stockholm-based electronic producer, [Sissel Wincent](https://soundcloud.com/sissel), to MailTape. In her own music, as well as within the [Drömfakulteten collective](https://dromfakulteten.tumblr.com/), Sissel deals in a congruous style of spacious and crisply detailed studio action, exploring the spaces behind and after the notes as much as what comes in between. 
<br><br>
Today's selection, however, trades in a joyous aqueous sound—with plenty of mallards, dolphin squeaks and alternating compressions.</p>


# Sissel Wincent's selection

## Ploy – =O
_Sissel Wincent_: **"**Gentle textures, soothing harmony, discreet bleeps—and some mallards.**"**

## [Kali Malone](http://kalimalone.com/) – Locus of Repetition
_Sissel Wincent_: **"**Pipe organ on a fine noise.**"**

## Mar-llena – Monorepos
_Sissel Wincent_: **"**Dolphin squeaks, waves, gloomy melodies and cleansing strings.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Sissel Wincent – Pearlescent Paint
_Sanjay_: **"**A brutally reduced minimal techno mover with a writhing acid line and spherical sound design that leaves all clichés behind and just does the job.**"**

## [Beatrice Dillon](http://www.dillonwork.com/) – Carrier and Mask
_Sanjay_: **"**Computerised, dubbed out percussion and samples meld with guitars, wah tubes, bass, pianet, and the percussive world of snare drum experiments and rhythmic balafon. Understated and playful.**"**

## Akiko Kiyama – Gabriel
_Sanjay_: **"**[Akiko Kiyama](http://akikokiyama.com/) is a classically trained musician turned electronic music composer. I think she has a knack for magnificently slinky, trippy music. Synths twitch anxiously over a booming kick-drum and the bounce here is paranoid but playful.**"**

## Afrikan Sciences – 43
_Sanjay_: **"**No stranger to MailTape, Eric Douglas Porter picked some Sunday morning tunes for us alongside Gaël Segalen as [Les Graciés](https://www.mailta.pe/319/les-gracies/) back in July. As [Afrikan Sciences](https://soundcloud.com/afrikan-sciences), however, Eric's study of rhythm fixates on the oddities—the mutations, the dualities and instances of bare collision.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Sissel Wincent](https://soundcloud.com/sissel) for her Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
