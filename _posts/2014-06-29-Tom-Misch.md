This morning, ladies and gentleman, please give a round of applause for our 18 yrs old composer, songwriter, guitarist, singer and violinist guest [Tom Misch](https://soundcloud.com/tom-misch "Tom Misch Soundcloud").

# Youth and good vibes

Tom Misch is one those artist who continiusly pruduces and streams high quality tunes over the internet. He rapidly drew attention with his [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/tom-misch "Tom Misch Soundcloud") account, full of wonders. You'd better not judge him on his youth. It is probably part of what gives him this very special ability to constantly deliver awesome vibes. His album [Beat Tape 1](http://tommisch1.bandcamp.com/album/beat-tape-1 "Tom Misch Bandcamp") is also available on BandCamp. Enjoy!

#His morning selection

## Nick Hakim - Cold
_Tom Misch:_ **"**Discovered Nick Hackim's music whilst browsing YouTube videos of Berkley College Music graduates. Instantly fell in love with his extremely smooth soulful voice and style. jazzy chord progressions and great lyrics this track is right up my street.**"**

## Emily King - Georgia
_Tom Misch:_ **"**Everything about this track and almost all Emily King's stuff is stunning. The acoustic instrumentation, the rhythms.. the way the bass sits with the kick drum yet still has its own groove.. the chord changes in the chorus.. Emily's vocal harmonies.. the old fashioned sounding strings.. the way the music accompanies her lyrics.. i could go on forever!! pure bliss.**"**

## J-Dilla - Track 34
_Tom Misch:_ **"**Third track obviously had to get a dilla joint in here.. this one starts with the track he sampled, then it drops and his genius comes into play. laid back tempo and a dirty swing on the drums. For me, this beat has an undeniable positivity leaking from it and that's why it's good for pretty much any day of the week.**"**
