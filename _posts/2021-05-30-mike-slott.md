# Mike Slott's selection

## Sam Gendel - Sustain
Mike Slott: **"**I live around the corner from a small park called Tierra de la Culebra and this is where Matthew David of Leaving Records used to host his brilliant ‘Listen to Music Outside in the Daylight Under a Tree’ park jams (before covid) on Saturday afternoons. Sam’s track sums up that LA weekend early afternoon feeling for me - sunny, synthy, live.
It was also released on Leaving Records so I guess it’s no coincidence. Im looking forward to those events again, sitting outside amongst friends, neighbors and musicians hearing lots of great new experimental music. **"**


## Huerco S - A Sea of Love
Mike Slott: **"**I like to meditate in the mornings when I wake up or to meditate on something I’ve read.

I put together a ‘mike meditation’ playlist of music that for me helps magnify what I’m reading or meditating on. I chose this Huerco S track because I listen to it a lot and to me it sound different every time I hear it. Or I should say I hear different aspects of it every time, it feels like it’s alive. A beautiful piece. **"**


## Luke Slott - The Keeper of Secrets
Good Morning TV: **"**I had to include a track from my brother Luke’s piano album. He released two solo piano volumes a few years back and for me they are a perfect compliment to any Sunday morning. Truly you could pick any of the tracks across the two albums. They transport me back to when we were younger and I would hearing him composing these songs note by note. Timeless music for a Sunday. Highly recommend checking out both solo piano albums. **"**
