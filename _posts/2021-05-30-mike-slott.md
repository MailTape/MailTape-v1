# Mike Slott's selection

## Sam Gendel - Sustain
Mike Slott: **"**I live around the corner from a small park called Tierra de la Culebra and this is where Matthew David of Leaving Records used to host his brilliant ‘Listen to Music Outside in the Daylight Under a Tree’ park jams (before covid) on Saturday afternoons. Sam’s track sums up that LA weekend early afternoon feeling for me - sunny, synthy, live.
It was also released on Leaving Records so I guess it’s no coincidence. Im looking forward to those events again, sitting outside amongst friends, neighbors and musicians hearing lots of great new experimental music. **"**


## Huerco S - A Sea of Love
Mike Slott: **"**I like to meditate in the mornings when I wake up or to meditate on something I’ve read.

I put together a ‘mike meditation’ playlist of music that for me helps magnify what I’m reading or meditating on. I chose this Huerco S track because I listen to it a lot and to me it sound different every time I hear it. Or I should say I hear different aspects of it every time, it feels like it’s alive. A beautiful piece. **"**


## Luke Slott - The Keeper of Secrets
Good Morning TV: **"**I had to include a track from my brother Luke’s piano album. He released two solo piano volumes a few years back and for me they are a perfect compliment to any Sunday morning. Truly you could pick any of the tracks across the two albums. They transport me back to when we were younger and I would hearing him composing these songs note by note. Timeless music for a Sunday. Highly recommend checking out both solo piano albums. **"**

# MailTape's selection

## Mike Slott - Keep Me Here
ImaCrea: **"**Mike Slott's latest album, Vignettes, was released on March 2020. A month we all remember here in France as the moment when COVID-19 entered in our life. I remember very vividly walking in deserted streets while we were under lockdown and listening to this track. It got me into a meditative state every walks, helping me soften my spirit as times were full of uncertainty. A perfect album to go for a walk with a camera and let oneself drift.**"**

## Leya - Wave
ImaCrea: **"**Let's keep walking. There's a sun ray coming from a crack into an abandoned building. Attracted by the mysterious light, you try to find a way to enter. Inside, a majestic chandelier hangs. An ethereal voice coming from nowhere, you look at the ceiling. Dust flying in the air reflects light... Leya has the secret to recreate almost spiritual moment while being firmly connected with the roughness of life in our decaying modern times.**"**

## Leon Vynehall - Ecce! Ego!
ImaCrea: **"**Slowly back to reality, you realize the building was an old factory. Big machines covered with rust, mechanical engines stopped in time and meters of cables on the floor. Leon is a very dear soul to my heart. One of the first live concert I experienced randomly as I was living in Berlin, a very special and beautiful souvenir. I kept listening to his music since then. Master of textures and layers, always redefining boundaries of electronic music. He released lastly a new album "Rare Forever". A great masterpiece not to miss.**"**

## PDP III - Calendar of Days
ImaCrea: **"**Still walking with us? Here's another one I enjoy listening on a Sunday when I go for a walk to immerge my eyes in the beauty of everyday life. Deeply immersive ambient track released by the great people at Shelter Press. PDP III is the reunion of Britton Powell, Lucy Railton and Brian Leeds (Huerco S). Yes...**"**
