<p id="introduction">Stay in bed a little longer this morning as Vancouver-based ambient musician, [Loscil](http://loscil.ca/), surrounds us in a breathless and dense mirage.</p>
<p>Mentored by Madala Kunene and Dr. Philip Tabane, Sibusile Xaba mixes fragmented lines with repeated phrases. Played acoustically to bass and drums – provided by percussionists Thabang Tabane and Moahanganai Magagula – Sibusile's music soars with expressive guitar-picking and a vocal style that is 'part dreamscape and part ancestral invocation'.</p>
<p>For our friends in Europe, Loscil will be performing in London, Nantes, Milan, Bergen and Wrocław this October and November.</p> 


# Loscil's selection


## Secret Pyramid - A Descent
_Loscil_: **"**Fellow Vancouverite [Amir Abbey](http://studentsofdecay.com/post/94162287649/secret-pyramid-the-silent-march) makes music filled with mysterious mirages and shadows. He’s one of my favourite local producers and his works sound especially good on cassette which I would highly recommend seeking out for a Sunday morning listen.**"**

## Sarah Davachi - Ghosts And All
_Loscil_: **"**[Sarah](http://www.sarahdavachi.com/index.html) is basically another local having lived in Vancouver for a time.  Her works are wonderfully microscopic and stripped down.  With this track, apparently, she primarily used the EMS-Synthi, a machine I also borrowed use of from my friend Josh Stevenson for my last record. Sarah is a master of the ancient synths.**"**

## Kara-Lis Coverdale and LXV - Informant
_Loscil_: **"**I am relatively new to the music of fellow Canadian [Kara-Lis Coverdale](https://kara-liscoverdale.bandcamp.com/) but I did see her perform a couple years back at Vancouver’s New Forms Festival and have been really enjoying her records. Very amorphous, rich and ever-shifting sound worlds with a forward momentum.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Loscil — Monument Builders
_Sanjay_: **"**Steeped in the influences of Zulu guitar giant Madala Kunene, Shaluza Max and Dr. Philip Tabane, this feels like an appropriate dedication for the occasion. Seeing Sibusile perform live a couple of months ago was a really special experience for me. Amid the playfully syncopated rhythms, Sibusile's voice captured and held my attention for the entire performance. Warm and direct, it was equally captivating as timbral whisper as when it stood tall. I can't wait to experience it again on Tuesday!**"**

## Isnaj Dui - East
_Sanjay_: **"**A brilliant example of Philip Tabane letting loose with intricate improvisation and free-form soloing that traces the history of gospel, blues and funk. Eschewing traditional chord structures, he coaxes free-form sounds by hitting the strings or sparking otherworldly melodies – all the while insisting you get up and dance!**"**

## Linda and Irene Buckley — Corpus Christi
_Sanjay_: **"**I've seen Bokani Dyer perform a few times at the Vortex in London and his latest album, [World Music](http://www.bokanidyer.com/listen/), reflects his inclusive musical philosophy. On this track he switches to keyboards, and with the drum always behind the beat, he combines a pop-fusion aesthetic with a cool 'neo-soul' sound.**"**

## Anna Clock — Has Sorrow Thy Young Days Shaded
_Sanjay_: **"**'Magnolia' is an ethereal polyrhythmic EP from vocalist [Miryam Solomon](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/). With guests including Seb Rochford, Shabaka Hutchings and Tansay Omar, her interplay with jazz harmonies entwined with electronic experimentation combine the continuities between jazz and folk beautifully.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for today. Thanks for listening and much love and thanks to [Loscil](http://loscil.ca/) for being our obliging guest this morning, and to [Anaïs Marthe Caura](https://vimeo.com/anaismarthecaura) for this episode's illustration!</p>
