<p id="introduction">Stay in bed a little longer this morning as Vancouver-based ambient musician, [Loscil](http://loscil.ca/), surrounds us with a breathless and dense mirage.</p>
<p>Creating his name from the compound of "loop" and "oscillate", Loscil primarily deals in icy textural atmospheres with eventual compositions opening up to include collaboration, improvisation, voices and acoustic instrumentation.</p>
<p>For our friends in Europe, Loscil will be performing in London, Nantes, Milan, Bergen and Wrocław this October and November.</p> 


# Loscil's selection


## Secret Pyramid - A Descent
_Loscil_: **"**Fellow Vancouverite [Amir Abbey](http://studentsofdecay.com/post/94162287649/secret-pyramid-the-silent-march) makes music filled with mysterious mirages and shadows. He’s one of my favourite local producers and his works sound especially good on cassette which I would highly recommend seeking out for a Sunday morning listen.**"**

## Sarah Davachi - Ghosts And All
_Loscil_: **"**[Sarah](http://www.sarahdavachi.com/index.html) is basically another local having lived in Vancouver for a time.  Her works are wonderfully microscopic and stripped down.  With this track, apparently, she primarily used the EMS-Synthi, a machine I also borrowed use of from my friend Josh Stevenson for my last record. Sarah is a master of the ancient synths.**"**

## Kara-Lis Coverdale and LXV - Informant
_Loscil_: **"**I am relatively new to the music of fellow Canadian [Kara-Lis Coverdale](https://kara-liscoverdale.bandcamp.com/) but I did see her perform a couple years back at Vancouver’s New Forms Festival and have been really enjoying her records. Very amorphous, rich and ever-shifting sound worlds with a forward momentum.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Loscil — Monument Builders
_Sanjay_: **"**Like flowers sprouting through the cracks of an abandoned locomotive, 'Monument Builders' is a tender record with fleeting and stark melodies throughout. Lose yourself this morning in a cavernous melancholy atmosphere.**"**

## Isnaj Dui - East
_Sanjay_: **"**I saw [Isnaj Dui (Katie English)](http://www.katie-english.net/) perform at Servant Jazz Quarters in London a few years ago and immediately reconciled this track with an episode like this. She delivered a brilliant performance of overlapping electronic loops from her flute, bass flute and a small homemade stringed instrument as she fired pulses of breath through the microphone to support her atmospheric vibrations.**"**

## Linda and Irene Buckley — Corpus Christi
_Sanjay_: **"**[Linda Buckley](http://www.lindabuckley.org/) was one of my first guests on MailTape and this episode is as good an excuse as any for a reintroduction. Perhaps a little early in the year for a carol for some but this feels like a glacially majestic addition to this morning's mirage.**"**

## Anna Clock — Has Sorrow Thy Young Days Shaded
_Sanjay_: **"**I don't know a lot about [Anna Clock](https://www.annaclock.com/)'s work, but I've recently been enjoying some of her many varied compositions and collaborations. In her own words, this is 'a kind of cover of an auld Irish tune that I love. Listen with headphones if you want to hear binaural bits'.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for today. Thanks for listening and much love and thanks to [Loscil](http://loscil.ca/) for being our obliging guest this morning, and to [Anaïs Marthe Caura](https://vimeo.com/anaismarthecaura) for this episode's illustration!</p>
