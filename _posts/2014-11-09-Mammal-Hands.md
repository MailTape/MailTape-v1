<p id="introduction">
If there’s one genre in music that can’t be easily defined then that unquestionably is jazz. This Sunday we will communicate with something truly inspirational; a band whose music can be best described as novelty; a trio who are known for their distinctive compositions, and sounds that elicit feelings of melancholy with a touch of subtlety in it. We bring you a relaxed morning with an advocate of the avant-garde and our band of the week [Mammal Hands](Mammal Hands Official Website "http://mammalhands.com/").</p>

# Savoring the unpredictable
The irregularity of this episode goes well along with jazz.  We have sounds ranging from mellow and trippy to blissful and progressively groovy.  Listening to this week’s episode is like predicting an unprecedented weather while having your fingers crossed, thus this Sunday morning we ask you to muse over what we call the unpredictable.

# Mammal Hands morning inspiration

## Richard Spaven - Whole Others
_Jesse Barrett:_ **"**I have been a fan of Richard Spaven for a while now, he has such a tasteful deep sound as a drummer and that comes across in this track which features The Hics. This tune flows with beautiful vocal lines and a sense of judiciously contained drum energy. Just right for me on a Sunday Morning.**"**
 
## Fofoulah - Make good
_Jordan Smart:_ **"**I've been really loving the slow rolling groove and vocals on this track. This band is full of players that I've really enjoyed from other projects, so this was a really nice discovery. The move from the opening saxophone harmonies into the drums would definitely help getting going on a Sunday morning.**"**
 
## Taylor Mc Ferrin - The Antidote
_Nick Smart:_ **"**This tune is from Taylor Mcferrin's new record Early Riser, which blends jazz tinged chord progressions with contemporary, off kilter electronic beats. This tune features some beautiful vocals from Nai Palm and would be a perfect mellow start to a Sunday morning.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to our guest [Mammal Hands](https://mammalhands.bandcamp.com/ "Mammal Hands Bandcamp") for their morning selection, to Kerstan Mackness for the contact, Simon Hut for the photo and Siddhartha for the writing. 
Enjoy your sunday.
