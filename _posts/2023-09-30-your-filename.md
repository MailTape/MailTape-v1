<p id="introduction">
	This morning, we're riding with [Tommy Guerrero](https://tommyguerrero.bandcamp.com/) on the road to good vibes.
When we talk about him, we usually recall his glorious past as a pro skateboarder, yet, for almost 30 years, it's in music that the legend of Tommy Guerrero continues to be written.
Slaloming between different styles, he now has around ten albums to his credit and he travels the whole world with his guitar to share sunny music, tinged with a characteristic sweetness, perfect for a Sunday morning.
	<br><br>
	So, the road we take today slides through different countries and different eras. This road is 100% instrumental and allows us to travel in a world mainly made of voluptuous keys, supportive percussion and guitars which have the magical power to transport us to this kind of old films from another time...
Ready? Follow the vibe!

# Tommy Guerrero's selection

## Hysear Don Walker - Poo jo

**Cindy Pooch**: **"**Don Walker was a funky pianist from Chicago who worked briefly with the Young-Holt Unlimited group. He also did a great deal of R & B studio work for Brunswick with many artists, including the Chi-lites, Jackie Wilson, Barbara Acklin, and many more...
**"**

## The Blonder - On The Beach

**"**Surf rock from Venezuela! A key band from the 60’s who used to play "surf music" with a unique touch.
**"**

## Yasuaki Shimizu - Kakashi

**"**A master, with a huge repertoire. Shimizu is a Japanese saxophonist and composer. This track is extracted from an album released in 82.
**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Tommy Guerrero - Future Deserts

Anto: **"**It’s difficult to extract a particular track from all of Tommy’s work. So I chose this one from the last album, because it makes me think of an exotic trick that would be difficult to copy, as if he wanted to take inspiration from of another player, while bringing his own touch. I particularly like this song because it's a duet, like a dance between guitar and keyboard under the eyes of a playful couple bass/drums.**"**

## Rockamovya – Take the night

Anto: **"**Rockamovya is a unique combination of talented musicians for an album that is too underestimated to my taste. The group is made up of jazz guitarist Will Bernard, three members of the reggae group Groundation (Harrison Stafford, Marcus Urani, Ryan Newman) and finally the legendary Jamaican drummer Leroy "Horsemouth" Wallace, unmissible guide in the movie called "Rockers" (if you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, hurry up and catch up!).
In the end, it gives us an album with an unstoppable groove, of which here is the opening title.**"**

## The Agamemnonz – Advice from the Lilac Fairy

Anto: **"**If you think we were back in the 60s, it's missed! The Agamemnonz is a contemporary French group, largely imbued with the codes of surf music. I find their virtuosity incredible. The rhythm is cleverly irregular, and punctuated by deliciously endless reverb, as if it were necessary to let all the nuances of certain notes sound.**"**

## Boris Gardiner Happening – Breezin’

Anto: **"**Finally, let's catch our breath with this piece by Boris Gardner Happening from 1972. Here the Jamaican artist shows us that there is more than just reggae on his island. The proof is in this languorous blues over which his guitar seems to glide, not without a certain grace.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! It was a good session; I feel like we’ve made some good moves. Thanks to [Tommy Guerrero](https://tommyguerrero.bandcamp.com/) for the selection and to Meriam for the illustration. See you next Sunday.</p>
