<p id="introduction">This groove-laden playlist is rich in bass and has a somewhat retro touch to it. Curated in collaboration with [Blutch](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blutch/333167113396807): a french artist—it adequately sets the mood as it lets music be the guide to your entire weekend journey while ensuring that you get your much needed respite.</p>

# Our latest fling

[Blutch](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blutch/333167113396807), our pick of the week, has the ability to make moments come alive. “Don’t you mind" & "Woman 2 Woman,” are the two tracks that we encourage you to dig and relax to.  The selection is also an instant release from everything that gets in the way of you and your early morning coffee.  The artists are promising and their music is meant to catch your ear. Go ahead and give it a go!


# Blutch's Sunday inspiration
 
## Sabata - Haze
_Blutch:_ **"**I don't get much to see Sunday morning very often, these rare moments are ponctuated with croissants and a good hot chocolate. In these harsh cold winter days, a gentle piano jazz beat with a pitched voice of Big Popa will help to attract the sun and start a comfortable and cosy day in bed.**"**
 
## D Dand - jus coolin'
_Blutch:_ **"**Let's keep on with something soft and a touch of energy to help you to leave the bed so you can enjoy your Sunday. By the way it's another French fellow.**"**
 
## Thrupence - Don't You Mind
_Blutch:_ **"**Simplicity is at the core of this masterpiece by Thrupence. Time to celebrate first smoke of the day, to get in shape and enjoy the usual Sunday morning movie.**"**
