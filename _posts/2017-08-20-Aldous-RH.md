# **Aldous RH's selection**

+ ## Silk Rhodes - Stuck in my Head
_Aldous RH_: **"**Mike & Sasha are good friends, and wonderful tunesmiths, particularly the work they do in Silk Rhodes is the perfect mixture of the sultry, smooth & the eclectic. Minimal soul at its finest and an adequate sensual Sunday accompaniment.**"**

+ ## Jerry Paper - Gracie II
_Aldous RH_: **"**Lucas has a real ear for the understated, his melodies are so strong yet so oblique. This tune however is probably his sweetest most direct ballad thus far. [Badbadnotgood](https://www.mailta.pe/110/bbng/ "MailTape 110") providing rhythm section too can never be bad when you're in the need for some subtle grooves.**"**

+ ## Bwengo Nuabey - Secondarny
_Aldous RH_: **"**This guy is second to none when it comes to quality over quantity. This one'll get you feeling all worldly + eastern intrigued. Essential sunday listening.**"**
