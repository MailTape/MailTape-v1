<p id="introduction">This morning, we challenge you to resist the lure of [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook"), the new and mysterious incarnation of Egyptian Hip-Hop's former frontman. With sounds as smooth and glossy as the milk in your artisanal coffee, tempered by [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook")'s own sugary croon, it'll be hard to not slurp this sultry concoction straight down, feeling the caffeinated kaleidoscope shimmer behind your eyes. Relinquish your aching 70s soul to this silky sonic lagoon deluxe.</p>


# **Aldous RH's selection**

+ ## Silk Rhodes - Stuck in my Head
_Aldous RH_: **"**Mike & Sasha are good friends, and wonderful tunesmiths, particularly the work they do in Silk Rhodes is the perfect mixture of the sultry, smooth & the eclectic. Minimal soul at its finest and an adequate sensual Sunday accompaniment.**"**

+ ## Jerry Paper - Gracie II
_Aldous RH_: **"**Lucas has a real ear for the understated, his melodies are so strong yet so oblique. This tune however is probably his sweetest most direct ballad thus far. [Badbadnotgood](https://www.mailta.pe/110/bbng/ "MailTape 110") providing rhythm section too can never be bad when you're in the need for some subtle grooves.**"**

+ ## Bwengo Nuabey - Secondarny
_Aldous RH_: **"**This guy is second to none when it comes to quality over quantity. This one'll get you feeling all worldly + eastern intrigued. Essential Sunday listening.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Aldous RH - Sensuality
_Inès_: **"**Aldous RH’s tunes are always so catchy, groovy and sensual, just like the name of this track. This song in particular is a favorite of mine, giving me life every time I listen to it. Just so so good.**"** 

+ ## Joey Fourr - Bath Thiem
_Inès_: **"**Smooth, blissful, luxurious synth-pop. The musical equivalent of satin bedsheets.**"**

+ ## Exit Someone - Absent Lover
_Inès_: **"**A beautiful, silky, melancholic track that I have been listening to on repeat lately. The voices, the synths, the ending... so elegant.**"**

+ ## Drugdealer - Suddenly (ft. Weyes Blood)
_Inès_: **"**Let’s end this episode on an joyful note. This song, featuring Weyes Blood, is one my favorites from their album "The End of Comedy". With its highs and lows, it feels like a musical, and makes us travel to California. You can almost feel the sun on your neck.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook") for his participation, Daisy for the wonderful writing and [Camille Célestin](https://www.facebook.com/bravocamo "Facebook") for the amazing illustration. Have a fabulous Sunday!</p>
