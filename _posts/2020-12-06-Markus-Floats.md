<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome Montréal-based producer, sound artist and audio/visual performer, [T. Gowdy](http://www.t-g0wd-y.org/), to select three exquisitely textured Sunday morning tunes with us. 
<br><br>
Tim's audio/visual performances have featured at Mutek (Montréal and Barcelona) and Spektrum (Berlin), alongside his ongoing work as an in-demand producer/engineer with over fifty album credits to date, including Suuns (Secretly Canadian), Ensemble (Fat Cat) and Ada Lea (Saddle Creek) to name just a few.

# Markus Floats's selection

## Ma$e (ft. Billy Lawrence) – Love U So
Markus Floats: **"**a favourite record on constellation. it evokes the feeling of floating through space, I can hear my breath, and there's a string ensemble rehearsing disjointed passages of neo-15th century riffs in the distance, a dream.**"**

## Ulla – Leaves and Wish
Markus Floats: **"**a highlight release this year. this track makes me want to sink deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into its corners. addictive listening. on a sunday morning sometimes I want to listen to music passively. other times, it’s cool to meditate on something. this is the track.**"**

## Folder – Reset
Markus Floats: **"**a collaboration project between ultrafog, mdo and ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ. this piece resets any clusters of neurons that have been colliding together during the busy work week. a refreshing sunday morning smoothie of fuzz and submersion**"**


# MailTape's selection

## T. Gowdy – Therapy With Colour
Sanjay: **"**One of my favourite releases this year. Each of the five songs on the EP has a distinct vibe but the whole feels like a cathartic antidote to technical biases endemic to digital production of most electronic music. This track begins the EP with lightly peppered pads and a low drone slowing rising up over a persistent and sinister pulse.**"**

## Isnaj Dui – Fjoeg
Sanjay: **"**I selected one of [Isnaj Dui](https://katie-english.net/)'s (Katie English) tracks on [Loscil's MailTape](https://www.mailta.pe/277/loscil/) selection back in September 2017. Here, Katie combines field recordings and sampling alongside her trademark concert and bass flutes and dulcimer. Unstable textures, dissonant harmonic structures and throbbing basslines create a soundscape that is at once serene and grating.**"**

## Félicia Atkinson – This is the Gate
Sanjay: **"**This is the ominously-titled closing track from previous MailTape guest [Félicia Atkinson](https://www.mailta.pe/294/felicia-atkinson/)'s latest release, 'Everything Evaporate'. Félicia seems to create the illusion that all of the instrumentation is floating, decontextualized, and untethered to any structure. Until the lingering tones converge into a warm embrace of rippling harmonies engulfed in a comforting sea of hiss.**"**

## Kali Malone – Litanic Cloth Wrung
Sanjay: **"**An intensely meditative dream of a piece from [Kali Malone](https://kalimalone.com/)'s album, 'The Sacrificial Code'. Soft, breathy warbles and minor-key melodies materialise in slow motion—cascading gently with metronomic precision.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [T. Gowdy](http://www.t-g0wd-y.org/) for his Sunday selections and to [Noémie Dijon](https://noemiedijon.tumblr.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
