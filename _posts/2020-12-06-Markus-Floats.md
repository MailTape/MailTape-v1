<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome Montréal-based producer, sound artist and audio/visual performer, [T. Gowdy](http://www.t-g0wd-y.org/), to select three exquisitely textured Sunday morning tunes with us. 
<br><br>
Tim's audio/visual performances have featured at Mutek (Montréal and Barcelona) and Spektrum (Berlin), alongside his ongoing work as an in-demand producer/engineer with over fifty album credits to date, including Suuns (Secretly Canadian), Ensemble (Fat Cat) and Ada Lea (Saddle Creek) to name just a few.

# Markus Floats's selection

## Ma$e (ft. Billy Lawrence) – Love U So
Markus Floats: **"**Remember this song? Harlem World? 1997! 23 years ago, haha! It’s ok to feel good for a while. It’s nuts out there but I’m giving you permission to feel good for a little while here. Bop around a bit. Roll your shoulders. Pretend to sing into a pantomimed microphone. Do a little one person wave when they go “Woo!”. It’s not illegal to smile, right? You deserve it. It’s nuts out there.**"**

## Change – Hold Tight
Markus Floats: **"**This song bangs. It’s by this studio band called Change from 1981. The lead singer on this track, Diva Gray, went on to do vocals with Chic, Sister Sledge, Roberta Flack, George Benson and Bette Midler. For real though, it’s nuts out there. It’s not just your imagination. Things are definitely and undeniably “getting worse” in a “Oh-Shit-Global-Collapse” kind of way, y’know? “Staring-You-In-The-Face-Sci-Fi-Dystopia” kind of vibes going on. And it’s not looking like things are gonna “get better” any time soon. The next decade or so is gonna be, pardon my french, fuckin’ rough. Let’s be real. If you’re like me and most of your life has been pretty good - not perfect of course, but generally quite comfortable - it’s all a bit overwhelming. I get it. What are you, a single person, supposed to do? You’ve only got at a handful of skills and they’re all starting to feel increasingly superfluous on a planet that’s falling apart.**"**

## Kashif – Baby Don’t Break Your Baby’s Heart
Markus Floats: **"**Mmm, listen to this groove though. Kashif is one of those freaks that kind of doesn’t have any bad songs. Like, across the first four albums there’s only a few duds. Most of them are total hot-shit bangers. Wait until you get to the xylophone part on this track, it rules. I don’t know where you are in the world or what you do, and I def don’t know what your life is like or what you’re going through so take this with a grain of salt, but...I think a totally solid thing you can do is to get involved in community organizing. Whether you do a few hours a month or go full-time-on-the-ground-grassroots-worker, every bit helps and the whole point is that no single person could possibly do all the work that needs to be done by themselves. It’s nuts out there! You’d be surprised how many people could use your particular skillset. So, I dunno, do a little googling. Find out what’s going on in your neighbourhood/municipality/city and find an organization doing something that directly impacts the lives of people in your area. Show up and keep showing up.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Markus Floats – Therapy With Colour
Sanjay: **"**One of my favourite releases this year. Each of the five songs on the EP has a distinct vibe but the whole feels like a cathartic antidote to technical biases endemic to digital production of most electronic music. This track begins the EP with lightly peppered pads and a low drone slowing rising up over a persistent and sinister pulse.**"**

## Le fruit vert – Qu'en pense le sablier?
Sanjay: **"**I selected one of [Isnaj Dui](https://katie-english.net/)'s (Katie English) tracks on [Loscil's MailTape](https://www.mailta.pe/277/loscil/) selection back in September 2017. Here, Katie combines field recordings and sampling alongside her trademark concert and bass flutes and dulcimer. Unstable textures, dissonant harmonic structures and throbbing basslines create a soundscape that is at once serene and grating.**"**

## Bill Withers – Grandma's Hands
Sanjay: **"**This is the ominously-titled closing track from previous MailTape guest [Félicia Atkinson](https://www.mailta.pe/294/felicia-atkinson/)'s latest release, 'Everything Evaporate'. Félicia seems to create the illusion that all of the instrumentation is floating, decontextualized, and untethered to any structure. Until the lingering tones converge into a warm embrace of rippling harmonies engulfed in a comforting sea of hiss.**"**

## Gino Soccio – Try it Out
Sanjay: **"**An intensely meditative dream of a piece from [Kali Malone](https://kalimalone.com/)'s album, 'The Sacrificial Code'. Soft, breathy warbles and minor-key melodies materialise in slow motion—cascading gently with metronomic precision.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [T. Gowdy](http://www.t-g0wd-y.org/) for his Sunday selections and to [Noémie Dijon](https://noemiedijon.tumblr.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
