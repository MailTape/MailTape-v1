<p id="introduction">This morning, we are thrilled to welcome pianist, organist, composer and bandleader, [Alexander Hawkins](http://www.alexanderhawkinsmusic.com/index.html) who is ‘unlike anything else in modern creative music’ (Ni Kantu).</p>
<p>Operating in myriad creative contexts (including Convergence Quartet, Decoy and 5 Blokes), his own highly distinctive soundworld is forged through the search to reconcile both his love of free improvisation and profound fascination with composition and structure.</p>
<p>A lot of the music I tend to listen to in the morning blends nuanced melody with a mysterious, porous, and textured sense of space. Either that, or it’s 1970’s Country from Ray Price, Mel Tillis, or—especially—Kenny Rogers’ second solo album (1976), which is understated country gold!</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of a kind of slow morning transition out of sleep:</p>



# **Alexander Hawkins's selection**

+ ## Harriet Tubman - Ritual Rubbin
_Alexander Hawkins_: **"**I'm a big fan of [Harriet Tubman](http://www.sunnysiderecords.com/artist.php?id=418). Brandon Ross's rhythmic concept is amazing to me. Like Bill Frisell or Otto Fischer, his lines have an incredible elasticity, whilst at the same time remaining completely in the pocket; similarly, they can have a meandering quality, at the same time as seeming completely inevitable. JT Lewis' drumming is also fantastic: pared down to the essentials of the groove, and somehow simultaneously heavy and dancing. I also love how the two DJs add to the texture here, and the great sample which drops at the end of this track.**"**

+ ## Elaine Mitchener - Love song ('how many way to say')
_Alexander Hawkins_: **"**I'm very proud to be a collaborator of [Elaine Mitchener](http://www.elainemitchener.com/). Yes, she has an astonishing technical command in a wide variety of idioms (here, there are very clear elements of both opera and R&B, for example); but what I think is most amazing about her artistry is her ability to synthesise her influences and facility at all times into something thoroughly compelling for the listener. She has particular gift in her ability to take an audience with her in even the most extreme and avant-garde settings. This short track is a nice introduction in many ways, showing both her awareness of the communicative power of a conventional melody, as well the expressive potential of the outer limits of the voice.**"**

+ ## Maurizio Pollini - Chopin: Ballade No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 23
_Alexander Hawkins_: **"**[Pollini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Pollini) is an obsession of mine. Like that of Thelonious Monk, his playing is completely stripped of any histrionics: it's concentrated, distilled, selfless musicality. Everything is in the service of the music, and it is through this that a giant character emerges, rather than through mannerisms and affectation (and goodness knows these are easily found in the music world). As was said of Monk, it's also true of Pollini: sentiment without the sentimentality. He is also inspirational for his uncompromising political views: to see real electricity in a performance, try to find the footage of him playing Beethoven for the workers in an occupied factory in Genoa in 1972. And I love Chopin; the more I listen, the weirder and more cryptic a lot of his work seems.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Alexander Hawkins - [K]now
_Sanjay_: **"**I first saw Fond of Tigers at 1067 in Vancouver back in 2008. Three albums and eight years later, they returned in late 2016 with [Uninhabit](https://fondoftigers.bandcamp.com/album/uninhabit). Lots more syncopated drums, contrapuntal melodies and carefree abandon...while keeping the groove firmly in the pocket. Vitamin Meathawk explored new territory for the group, on which Toronto's [Sandro Perri](http://www.sandroperri.com/) adds his brand of gentle, husky vocals.**"** 

+ ## Muhal Richard Abrams - Expression 1
_Sanjay_: **"**I'm a newcomer to composer Martin Arnold and much of [Arraymusic](http://www.arraymusic.com/)'s output. I love the strange friction between the open, plangent quality of the singing here, and the weblike instrumental work from Callum McSherry, the Quatuor Bozzini quartet and University of Bristol New Music Ensemble.**"**

+ ## Alarm Will Sound - Particularly Competitive
_Sanjay_: **"**The music of [Saltland](http://www.saltland.ca/)/[Rebecca Foon](http://www.rebeccafoon.com/)/[Esmerine](http://www.esmerine.com/) is to me what Efterklang is to Stephen: music capabale of articulating a forlorn yet rousing sense of hope. Magnolia is from Saltland's latest release (just last week), _A Common Truth_, on Montréal's delightfully irrepresible [Constellation Records](http://cstrecords.com/).**"**

+ ## Stefan Christoff & David Parker - Beyond Injustice
_Sanjay_: **"**Ending with yet more hope. Most fans of [Esmerine](http://www.esmerine.com/) will be acquainted with the characteristically morose, sparse and tranquil violin sounds that give way to the rumble and swell of drums and bass and explosive guitar peaks. But it doesn’t make it any less enjoyable here.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today! Thanks to [Alexander Hawkins](http://www.alexanderhawkinsmusic.com/index.html) for his participation and [Camille Célestin](http://www.slipontherock.com/) for the illustration. Have a wonderful Sunday!</p>
