<p id="introduction">This morning, we delve into a hypnotic world with Heta Bilaletdin, Jonna Karanka and Katri Sipiläinen of Finland-based trio [Olimpia Splendid](https://www.facebook.com/Olimpia-Splendid-197293963659766/).</p>
<p>Named after a brand of air conditioners, they make wiry, hypnotic and out-of tune DIY punk with guitars, bass and a drum machine; 'full of dirty, sexy psych rock topped with high pitched, breathy female vocals and whispery growls' (The Wire).</p>

# Olimpia Splendid's selection


## Miaux - Above the High Rays
_Jonna_: **"**Just enough melancholy and tender slowness for Sunday morning from the amazing [Miaux](https://www.facebook.com/miamiaux/).**"**

## Tsembla - Alejandro
_Katerina_: **"**This is a track by Marja Johansson aka [Tsembla](http://tsembla.com/). I think it is a nice relaxing track for Sunday. The title as I know refers to [Jodorowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky). I feel the same space as in his films in this song. You might want to check out also [this funny cool music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4gFjvCMIbM) - it was made by friends one summer hanging in the countryside of Finland.**"**

## TV Dinner Education - Who R D Rules
_Heta_: **"**The song I chose for Sunday morning is _Who R D Rules_ by TV DINNER EDUCATION. It's a bit rusty and clumsy but uplifting, goes well together with coffee.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Olimpia Splendid - Jukka-Pekka
_Sanjay_: **"**Succinct and short, Nate's version is almost unrecognisable from Wynton Marsalis's original. He slows the melody down to bring it out of focus and lets the soloists emerge in more mysterious ways. [Harris Eisenstadt](http://www.harriseisenstadt.com/)'s drumming and [Elvin Opsvik](http://eivindopsvik.com/)'s strong pulse add an intensity, especially to [Matt Moran](http://mattmoran.com/bio.html)'s vibe work.**"**

## Marisa Anderson - In the Valley of the Sun
_Sanjay_: **"**A jaunty break in the road with the arrival of this strong and swinging melody. Of course, a tune with either of these two players would not be complete if this sense was not dissipated for a brief turn in the road and free meander.**"**

## Karen Gwyer - Judd Drums
_Sanjay_: **"**Less is more here, but with substance and depth from this cool trio, Glue, with [Tom Arthurs](http://www.tomarthurs.co.uk/) on trumpet, [Miles Perkin](http://www.milesperkin.com/) on bass and [Yorgos Dimitriadis](https://yorgosdimitriadis.com/) on percussion. Even if there is no rhythm or harmonic development, the sounds move forward with little notes getting stretched and going beyond any pattern, but beautifully, full of surprises and relatively accessible.**"**

## Carla dal Forno - You Know What It's Like
_Sanjay_: **"**A dark and brooding piece, which evolves into a lightness and quiet beauty to complete this rain-inspired issue. A Satie-esque air emerges from the small percussion by [Kaja Draksler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Gpvgcu3X_MyVWaSeJLwMeFAV_ALhQj-) on the strings, which [Susana Santos Silva](https://susanasantossilva.com/) picks up on for a lovely ending.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today! Thanks to Heta, Jonna and Katri for their brilliant selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for the great illustration! And if you're eligible to vote in the UK on 8th June, remember to [unite against barbarism](https://www.tactical2017.com/).</p>
