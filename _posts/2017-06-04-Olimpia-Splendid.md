<p id="introduction">This morning, we enter a hypnotic world with Heta Bilaletdin, Jonna Karanka and Katri Sipiläinen of Finland-based trio, [Olimpia Splendid](https://www.facebook.com/Olimpia-Splendid-197293963659766/).</p>
<p>Named after a brand of air conditioners, they make wiry, hypnotic and out-of-tune DIY punk with guitars, bass and a drum machine; an 'uptempo rattle of no-note guitar licks and no-brain bass riffs that kicks and jerks like a barracuda on a bait line' ([The Wire](https://www.thewire.co.uk/)).</p>

# Olimpia Splendid's selection


## Miaux - Above the High Rays
_Jonna_: **"**Just enough melancholy and tender slowness for Sunday morning from the amazing [Miaux](https://www.facebook.com/miamiaux/).**"**

## Tsembla - Alejandro
_Katerina_: **"**This is a track by Marja Johansson aka [Tsembla](http://tsembla.com/). I think it is a nice relaxing track for Sunday. The title as I know refers to [Jodorowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky). I feel the same space as in his films in this song. You might want to check out also [this funny cool music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4gFjvCMIbM) - it was made by friends one summer hanging in the countryside of Finland.**"**

## TV Dinner Education - Who R D Rules
_Heta_: **"**The song I chose for Sunday morning is 'Who R D Rules' by TV DINNER EDUCATION. It's a bit rusty and clumsy but uplifting, goes well together with coffee.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Olimpia Splendid - Jukka-Pekka
_Sanjay_: **"**Olimpia Splendid made me want to explore the Finnish DIY scene I was completely ignorant of before seeing them at Cafe OTO in London last year. Their music traipses along on hot ash, occasionally striking something sharp or sinking in a few inches, but mostly just indiscernibly searing the skin. I think Jukka-Pekka ([and its video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULuR2quJ6U0)) capture the band pretty accurately for a Sunday morning, though. **"**

## Marisa Anderson - In the Valley of the Sun
_Sanjay_: **"**The most recent time I saw [Marisa Anderson](https://marisaandersonmusic.com/) perform was in a small loft at [The Old Hairdresser's](http://theoldhairdressers.com/) in Glasgow. And I could listen to her music all day on repeat. Bass notes often drone with presence and open strings are laden with sparks that are usually hidden. It makes gestures toward loud, but it's more about solitude for me. This is one of many selections I could have gone with.**"**

## Karen Gwyer - Judd Drums
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from London-based musician, [Karen Gwyer](http://karengwyer.com/). This track was produced after London's Public Information label invited some contemporary musicians to reinterpret the work of electronics pioneer [F.C. Judd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Judd). This track fills the space around the source material with percussion and lolling melodic lines, using the "fiddly complexity" of Judd's rhythms from 'Drum Song' as a springboard to have some real fun.**"**

## Carla dal Forno - You Know What It's Like
_Sanjay_: **"**The title track from [Carla dal Forno](https://www.facebook.com/carladalfornoyes/)'s debut album, 'You Know What It’s Like', feels like it lurks somewhere in the familiar shadowy greys and stark minimalism of much of her previous output. It opens with a distorted, wind-chime sort of jingling before the drums kick in with a relentlessly steady beat. A perfect end to this hypnotic and dreamy issue.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today! Thanks to Heta, Jonna and Katri for their brilliant selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for the great illustration! And if you're eligible to vote in the UK on 8th June, remember to [unite against barbarism](https://www.tactical2017.com/).</p>
