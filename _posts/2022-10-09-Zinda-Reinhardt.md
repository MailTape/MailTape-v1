# Zinda Reinhardt's selection

## Lena Platonos - Bloody Shadows From Afar
Zinda Reinhardt: **"**This voice, this Greek mother tongue, this sensual minimalism speaks to me a lot... Pioneer of electronic music, she uses deep and heavy synthesizers in this piece, completely out of step with her time, she pierces with her interpretation a whole poetic and erotic landscape.
I like everything of her and it dates but it remains so current for me, I will have only one word... timeless.**"**

## Bob Vylan - Wicked And Bad
Zinda Reinhardt: **"**English trash as I like it, musical, rhythmic, tackling the social and political problems of British life. A mix of Jamaican dance-hall that makes you dance like a madwoman wherever you are, and the violence of their flow that comes close to dark rock, a return to the rage against the machine that gives you strength and power to say "fuck" to everything that breaks you.**"**

## Lido Pimienta - Para Transcribir
Zinda Reinhardt: **"**Recent and surprising discovery, in the incredible unique voice genre, she is amazing. She is a kind of warrior poetess with engaged texts, who succeeded in combining electro with Colombian trad music with finesse. I find myself very much in her musical work and the emotion that emerges from it. She makes the hairs stand up and sometimes shed a few tears. It feels so good!**"**
