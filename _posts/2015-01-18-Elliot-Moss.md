<p id="introduction">This morning, let the young talented [Elliot Moss](https://www.facebook.com/elliotmossmusic "Elliot's on Facebook") and his dreamy inspiration help us in our attempt to get over this hangover we’re all feeling since the 7th. The human brain is a strange thing filled with many secrets, sometimes capable of spreading beautiful light other times capable
 to express the darkest atrocities.
<br><br>
Never forget light is in all of us and if you feel it harder to make it shine in these days, don’t try too hard. Let the music play, close your eyes, feel the moment and let the surprise happen. Soon, light will flow back in your veins, you might be scared of the direction it will show you but it never fails. Follow it, trust yourself and never be afraid to be free to shine, like Charlie used to and will keep doing.</p>

# Elliot’s gonna take care of you.

He’s only 20 years old and still, he manages to bring a very mature and detailed music. Filled with moody poetry and sensitive composition, his debut album [“Highspeeds”](https://elliotmoss.bandcamp.com/ "Discover his debut album now") will take its listeners on an introspective journey. Perfect to relax and slow down, it develops an atmosphere particularly adapted for a Sunday afternoon spent with good friends. It will make you at ease to speak or think about what really matters for you which is, after all, what’s one looking for when appreciating a great piece of art.

# Elliot Moss's morning inspiration
 
## Apparat - Out of Sight
_Elliot Moss:_ **"**This is one of my favorite tunes from him. Detailed programming and shaky synths make up a dark track that he floats a gorgeous vocal on top of.
**"**
 
## Mitski - I Will
_Elliot Moss:_ **"**My friend mitski just put out one of the most honest, raw, and at the same time, beautiful records I’ve heard all year and she’s getting a lot of well-deserved praise for it. This track feels nice for a Sunday morning but you should go find the rest if you haven’t already.**"**
 
## Francesca Belmonte - Stole
_Elliot Moss:_ **"**Love the close-up vocal and choppy/beat-repeating guitar on this tune. feel like it never really settles into any one groove, which gives it this anxious thing that absolutely I love.**"**
