# Elliot Moss's morning inspiration
 
## Apparat - Out of Sight
_Elliot Moss:_ **"**This is one of my favorite tunes from him. Detailed programming and shaky synths make up a dark track that he floats a gorgeous vocal on top of.
**"**
 
## Mitski - I Will
_Elliot Moss:_ **"**My friend mitski just put out one of the most honest, raw, and at the same time, beautiful records I’ve heard all year and she’s getting a lot of well-deserved praise for it. This track feels nice for a Sunday morning but you should go find the rest if you haven’t already.**"**
 
## Francesca Belmonte - Stole
_Elliot Moss:_ **"**Love the close-up vocal and choppy/beat-repeating guitar on this tune. feel like it never really settles into any one groove, which gives it this anxious thing that absolutely I love.**"**
