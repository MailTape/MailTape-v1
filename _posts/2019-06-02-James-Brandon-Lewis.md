<p id="introduction"> This morning we are pleased to welcome saxophonist and composer, [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com), to select three spiritually-inspired Sunday morning tunes with us.
<br><br>
James Brandon Lewis articulates a big sound and deftly reconciles the worlds of the spiritual and the cerebral. But there isn't an easy shorthand for his musical approach. Ever since his early releases—_Moments_, _Divine Travels_—the New York-based saxophonist has balanced a deep, gospel-informed spirituality with free jazz abandon.

# James Brandon Lewis's selection

##  Ornette Coleman – The Blessing
_James Brandon Lewis_: **"**A classic tune, simply because I grew up going to church. The title is fitting...it is very much a blessing this life is!**"**

## Duke Ellington & Mahalia Jackson – Come Sunday
_James Brandon Lewis_: **"**One of my grandmother's favorite singers...so much soul and flavor.**"**

## Charlie Haden & Hank Jones – Take My Hand Precious Lord
_James Brandon Lewis_: **"**I had the privilege of studying with Charlie Haden at the California Institute of the Arts...a beautiful soul...of course Hank Jones is a legend.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## James Brandon Lewis – The Preacher's Baptist Beat
_Sanjay_: **"**Taken from [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com)'s 'Divine Travels' album, we hear James unafraid to play in a spiritual manner; his lines sway with fervour, mixing the blues shouts with shouts of hallelujah alongside poet [Thomas Sayers Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sayers_Ellis) who reads with the trio.**"**

## Wadada Leo Smith – Najwa
_Sanjay_: **"**In remembrance of a love lost, 'Najwa' revisits, in a way, [Wadada Leo Smith](https://wadadaleosmith.com/)'s earliest influences with a guitar album of sorts. As such, the album celebrates past masters of creative music: Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Ronald Shannon Jackson and Billie Holiday. It features four guitarists—[Michael Gregory Jackson](http://michaelgregoryjackson.com/), [Henry Kaiser](http://www.henrykaiserguitar.com/), [Brandon Ross](https://www.brandonross.nyc) and Lamar Smith—who paint translucent colours over odd, muscular bass, drums and percussion grooves performed by [Bill Laswell](https://billlaswell.bandcamp.com/), [Pheeroan akLaff](https://www.pheeroanaklaff.com/) and [Adam Rudolph](https://metarecords.com/adam.html), respectively.**"**

## Susana Santos Silva – No Trees Land
_Sanjay_: **"**On this album, 'Impermanence', Susana Santos Silva combines plenty of feints and decoys before unleashing her furious assaults on trumpet. **"**

## Casimir Liberski, Tyshawn Sorey & Thomas Morgan – Evanescence I
_Sanjay_: **"**A last title to close this playist that leaves me speechless as much by the genius of the artist as by the length of it. Yussef D., known to be a member of the duo Yussef Kaamal, literally transports us into a parallel world.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday! Much love and respect to [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for his stunning illustration.</p>
