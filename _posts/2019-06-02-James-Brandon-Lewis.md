<p id="introduction"> This morning we are pleased to welcome well-versed saxophonist and composer [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com) to select three church-inspired Sunday morning tunes with us.
<br><br>
[Felbm](https://felbm.com/), just some piano notes, a little jazzy and minimalist. Some cool stuff with electro sounds that comes from his native Holland. Some beautiful things, like the spring coming or the warmth of the sun on our faces.
</p>

# James Brandon Lewis's selection

##  Ornette Coleman – The Blessing
_James Brandon Lewis_: **"**A classic tune, simply because I grew up going to church. The title is fitting...it is very much a blessing this life is!**"**

## Duke Ellington & Mahalia Jackson – Come Sunday
_James Brandon Lewis_: **"**One of my grandmother's favorite singers...so much soul and flavor. **"**

## Charlie Haden & Hank Jones – Take My Hand Precious Lord
_James Brandon Lewis_: **"**I had the privilege of studying with Charlie Haden at the California Institute of the Arts...a beautiful soul...of course Hank Jones is a legend.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## James Brandon Lewis – The Preacher's Baptist Beat
_AnaïsG_: **"**The choice is hard when you start listening to Felbm [Tapes](https://felbm.bandcamp.com/). From classical sounds to more jazzy sounds, from plant sweetness to more minimalist music. He is the sage who will make us think and meditate just by listening to his music.**"**

## Wadada Leo Smith – Najwa
_AnaïsG_: **"**With its subtlety and elegance, it was obvious that Kiefer’s music was part of this selection. Originally from Los Angeles, this multi-instrumentalist panist surprises us and makes us melt with his jazz-hip hop sounds.**"**

## Susana Santos Silva – No Trees Land
_AnaïsG_: **"**A classic that I rediscovered during a stay in Paris by chance in a hotel room. Thanks to my boyfriend for this sweet moment.**"**

## Casimir Liberski, Tyshawn Sorey & Thomas Morgan – Evanescence I
_AnaïsG_: **"**A last title to close this playist that leaves me speechless as much by the genius of the artist as by the length of it. Yussef D., known to be a member of the duo Yussef Kaamal, literally transports us into a parallel world.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday! Much love and respect to [James Brandon Lewis](http://www.jblewis.com/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for his stunning illustration.</p>
