# Rivers and storms

Rivers are constant liquid flows which inexorably and continiously move from a point A to a point B. Their regularity is both reensuring and relaxing. At the contrary, storms are ponctual and extreme events, which do not last overtime. They are sudden and unpredictable. In less than an hour, today's MailTape will litteraly make you experience both of these phenomenon through a unique music journey. Enjoy!

# Douglas Dare's morning inspiration
 
## iamamiwhoami - Thin
_Douglas Dare:_ **"**I'm a big fan of her voice and it's always the vocals that draw me to an artist. It's got a beautiful/ugly quality. This track also has two of my favourite things, a fade in and a tempo change. Been on repeat!**"**
 
## Andy Stott - Violence
_Douglas Dare:_ **"**Love the dynamic of this track and how unexpected it is. And it's so dark! It's been the perfect soundtrack to driving through US cities at night.**"**
 
## Buke and Gase - Seam Esteem
_Douglas Dare:_ **"**I can't help but slowly head bang to this track; it puts me in a trance. It's one of their more understated tracks, which I like because it's subtly groves and makes you want more.**"**
