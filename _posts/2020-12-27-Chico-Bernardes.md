# Chico Bernardes's selection

## Harry Nilsson – Miss Butter's Lament
Chico: **"**I got in touch with Nilsson's work a few years ago, when a friend of my father showed me the "Nilsson Sings Newman" record, and I loved it, spent lots of days listening on repeat. This song I chose from "Nilsson Sessions 1967-1968" has this beautiful and inspiring arrangement that I really enjoy to hear.**"**

## Molly Drake – I Remember
Chico: **"**It was outstanding when I heard Molly Drake for the first time. It got me to rethink about the technical aspects of a recording. The way her voice and piano sound on old tape hiss is so nostalgic. I'm a big fan of Nick Drake as well, both of them share some special beauty with simplicity, which is something I search for in my songs.**"**

## Maria Bethânia – Olhe o Tempo Passando
Chico: **"**I really love Maria Bethânia's voice, and this song has such beautiful arrangements. The lyrics talk about the heartbreaking aspect of time flying while the lover waits for the other one that won't come back. Classic story, everybody been there, I guess. Really enjoy this record, " A Tua Presença", from 1971.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Chico Bernardes – Em Meu Lugar
Sarah: **"**Chico wrote this song in the beginning of this year, sitting alone with his guitar at the top one of Portugal's hotel buildings. Em Meu Lugar, meaning In My Place, describes how all of Chico's thoughts live within him, including the people he loves, his memories, and his experiences of emotion. All of it together molds his inner world, one that travels wherever he does. The song recognizes his immediate solitude but also takes comfort in the world within him. Speaking to Chico about the song's production, the track takes on an entirely new significance during its recording experience. The soaring instrumentals and striking harmonies made up by the violins, trumpets, violas, and clarinets were all recorded remotely by each musician during Brazil's quarantine, patched together to form this seamless composite of sound. Wonderful :)**"**

## Elan Noon – Modern Blues
Sarah: **"**The late Bill Withers needs no introduction; suffice to say this is my favourite non-romantic love song.**"**

## Piry Reis – Half The Day Is The Night
Sarah: **"**This track comes from the 1970 debut album of Brazilian guitarist Piry Reis (known on this album as Piri), called "Vocês Querem Mate?”. I love the track's comfort and even dynamic tangling with dissonance. This song and the entire album features Brazilian folk traditions of bossa and samba patterned with the psychedelic influences of the 1970’s in the most delightful way :)**"**

## Gábor Szabó – San Franciscan Nights
Sarah: **"**This track comes off of the 1968 album Dreams, one of many fantastic releases by Hungarian guitarist Gábor Szabó. I love how this song intertwines rolling samba and traditional Hungarian **"**
