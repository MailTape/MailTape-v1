# Chico Bernardes's selection

## Harry Nilsson – Miss Butter's Lament
Chico: **"**I got in touch with Nilsson's work a few years ago, when a friend of my father showed me the "Nilsson Sings Newman" record, and I loved it, spent lots of days listening on repeat. This song I chose from "Nilsson Sessions 1967-1968" has this beautiful and inspiring arrangement that I really enjoy to hear.**"**

## Molly Drake – I Remember
Chico: **"**It was outstanding when I heard Molly Drake for the first time. It got me to rethink about the technical aspects of a recording. The way her voice and piano sound on old tape hiss is so nostalgic. I'm a big fan of Nick Drake as well, both of them share some special beauty with simplicity, which is something I search for in my songs.**"**

## Maria Bethânia – Olhe o Tempo Passando
Chico: **"**I really love Maria Bethânia's voice, and this song has such beautiful arrangements. The lyrics talk about the heartbreaking aspect of time flying while the lover waits for the other one that won't come back. Classic story, everybody been there, I guess. Really enjoy this record, " A Tua Presença", from 1971.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Chico Bernardes – Em Meu Lugar
Sarah: **"**With recurrent tumbling notes and angular drawn-out drones throughout, Markus somehow manages to keep this track sounding like a pleasant walk in open habitat. Different arpeggios work against one another, as this final track on 'Third Album' reiterates many of the sounds, textures and timbres heard previously.**"**

## Elan Noon – Modern Blues
Sarah: **"**The late Bill Withers needs no introduction; suffice to say this is my favourite non-romantic love song.**"**

## Gábor Szabó – Half The Day Is The Night
Sarah: **"**This track comes off of the 1968 album Dreams, one of many fantastic releases by Hungarian guitarist Gábor Szabó. I love how this song intertwines rolling samba and traditional Hungarian **"**

## Gábor Szabó – San Franciscan Nights
Sarah: **"**Rounding off this week's playlist with some more bouncin' boogie beats in the form of another killer early 80s one-off jam from Keni Burke's brother, Cubie.**"**
