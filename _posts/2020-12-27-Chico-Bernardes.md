# Chico Bernardes's selection

## Harry Nilsson – Miss Butter's Lament
Chico: **"**I got in touch with Nilsson's work a few years ago, when a friend of my father showed me the "Nilsson Sings Newman" record, and I loved it, spent lots of days listening on repeat. This song I chose from "Nilsson Sessions 1967-1968" has this beautiful and inspiring arrangement that I really enjoy to hear.**"**

## Molly Drake – I Remember
Chico: **"**It was outstanding when I heard Molly Drake for the first time. It got me to rethink about the technical aspects of a recording. The way her voice and piano sound on old tape hiss is so nostalgic. I'm a big fan of Nick Drake as well, both of them share some special beauty with simplicity, which is something I search for in my songs.**"**

## Maria Bethânia – Olhe o Tempo Passando
Chico: **"**I really love Maria Bethânia's voice, and this song has such beautiful arrangements. The lyrics talk about the heartbreaking aspect of time flying while the lover waits for the other one that won't come back. Classic story, everybody been there, I guess. Really enjoy this record, " A Tua Presença", from 1971.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Markus Floats – Forward Always
Sarah: **"**With recurrent tumbling notes and angular drawn-out drones throughout, Markus somehow manages to keep this track sounding like a pleasant walk in open habitat. Different arpeggios work against one another, as this final track on 'Third Album' reiterates many of the sounds, textures and timbres heard previously.**"**

## Bill Withers – Grandma's Hands
Sarah: **"**The late Bill Withers needs no introduction; suffice to say this is my favourite non-romantic love song.**"**

## Gino Soccio – Try it Out
Sarah: **"**A horn-laden wiggler from the early 80s, and wow, that fat plucked dust-raising bassline, too! This track also featured a salacious trumpet solo from Roger Walls and feelgood vocals by Memphis singer Erma Shaw.**"**

## Cubie Burke – Down for Double
Sarah: **"**Rounding off this week's playlist with some more bouncin' boogie beats in the form of another killer early 80s one-off jam from Keni Burke's brother, Cubie.**"**
