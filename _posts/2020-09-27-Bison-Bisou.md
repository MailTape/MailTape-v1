<p id="introduction">This morning, we are in transition from remembering the warmth of our summer to the coolness of the rainy days. It's all about fighting the outside elements with big guitar riffs, big sounds that tap and accompany the musical selection of the band Bison Bisou to warm up the atmosphere.
<br><br>

It is under this pretty name that he destroys the codes and creates the contrast with their music. Powerful rock to wake up your body, and your mind, [Bison Bisou](https://bisonbisou.bandcamp.com/) understands that. A soundtrack accompanying our energetic mornings running on the beach or our long summer evenings around a fire with friends.

# Bison Bisou's selection

## Jenny Hval - The Great Undressing
Bison Bisou: **"**The way [Jenny Hval](http://jennyhval.com/) criticizes capitalism and sexism is so sweet and pure. This song is one of the most clever lullabies ever. Marvelous like a never-ending-wishing dream.**"**

## [Girl Band](https://girlband.ie/) - Shoulderblade
Bison Bisou: **"**We expected a lot from Girl Band after listening to their music and watching their lives for a while.We weren’t disappointed when we saw their [new video for Shoulderblade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdnA7qQCF0k) : after countless times seeing it, we still share the same weird shiver, out of some sort of post-industrial transe. It's the ideal song to wake up on a sunday in a dying city.**"** 

## Prayers - From Dog To God
Bison Bisou: **"**5, 6, 7, 8 in the morning. Walking to the sunrise. Music from broken-mirror smartphone invading the streets. Wondering if you’re a god or a dog, the party was raw. You’re alone in this world like the sun in our solar system.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Bison Bisou](https://www.facebook.com/BisonBisou) – Peaches Forever
Anaïs G: **"**"[Pain & Pleasure](https://bisonbisou.bandcamp.com/)", released last October, is an album that accompanied me this winter and again throughout this confinement, during these two months. I didn't think I'd be so turned on by their music, so it was hard for me to choose just one song among the eleven, but I set my heart on Peaches Forever, which represents perfection! Sweet and energetic moments, for a Sunday morning in subdued tones!**"**

## Hidden Fees – So What
Anaïs G: **"**A band straight out of New York, with an old school song with tunes by [Mick Jagger](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger) from [the Rolling Stones](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones). Sunny and motivating to attack the week ahead!**"**

## [Mama's Gun](https://www.facebook.com/MamasGunMusic/) – Shield & Shelter
Anaïs G: **"**During the auditions for "Les Inouis du Printemps de Bourges" last year at the [CCM John Lennon](https://www.facebook.com/ccmjohnlennon/) in Limoges, I discovered a band with incredible energy and a crazy universe, [Mama's Gun](https://soundcloud.com/mamas-gun-77509736). A crush that I share here!**"**

## [Map of Africa](https://soundcloud.com/map-of-africa)  – Bone
Anaïs G: **"**Sometimes I come across nuggets, and the Map of Africa group is one of them. A perfect sound with a touch of blues, a somewhat wandered voice and a somewhat sexy mood in the use of guitars that transcends us!**"**
