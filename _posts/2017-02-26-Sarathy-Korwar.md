<p id="introduction">This morning, transcend borders with mantras, untethered saxophones, keys, and an unfettered groove from our guest, percussionist and composer, [Sarathy Korwar](http://www.sarathykorwar.com/).</p>

<p>Signed to [Ninja Tune](https://ninjatune.net/release/sarathy-korwar/day-to-day) with his debut album, _Day to Day_, Sarathy has been trained as a classical tabla player under the guidance of Shri Rajeev Devasthali and [Pandit Sanju Sahai](http://www.sanjusahai.com/), and is equally at ease on the tabla and drum-kit. If you happen to be in that part of the world, you can also [see him live at SXSW](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2017/artists/13219) in Austin, Texas, next month.</p>



# **Sarathy Korwar’s selection**

+ ## Cara Stacey - Dark Matter
_Sarathy Korwar_: **"**From my dear friend [Cara Stacey](http://www.carastacey.com/)'s amazing album, _Things That Grow_. Beautiful compositions with Southern African bows at the centre of all the sonic exploration.**"**

+ ## Maalem Mahmoud Guinia & Floating Points - Mimoun Marhaba
_Sarathy Korwar_: **"**Think this is a very sympathetic collboration between the musicians involved and I especially like how subtle the electronics are. And of course the hand clapping pattern!**"**

+ ## Emanative - Hum Allah Hum Allah Hum Allah
_Sarathy Korwar_: **"**Saw [Idris Ackamoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_Ackamoor) play recently and he and his band were amazing, they brought such a great vibe with them on stage. This track by [Emanative](https://emanative.bandcamp.com/) featured some beautiful textures and great horn playing. It just sets the mood so well.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Sarathy Korwar - Indefinite Leave to Remain
_Sanjay_: **"**Taken from Sarathy’s debut album on Ninja Tune, _Day-to-Day_, Indefinite Leave to Remain feels like a complete surrender to the performance. Beginning with contrapuntal notes on the piano, which become percussive in their repetition before field recordings of chants from the Sidi community in India arrive midway through. Then it shifts to a series of dissonant chords on the piano and heads into a lovely passage of improvisation before returning to its origin. Beautiful!**"** 

+ ## Harriet Tubman - Probe

_Sanjay_: **"**For this edition of Harriet Tubman – named after one of the most important figures in U.S. and world history, abolitionist [Harriet Tubman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman) – the regular longstanding trio of bassist Melvin Gibbs, guitarist Brandon Ross and drummer JT Lewis are joined by trumpeter Ron Miles and turntablists DJ Logic and DJ Singe. This track is embedded in the groove, liberally tossing jazz, funk, rock, dub and a little electronica into a heavy, dancing and murky sonic stew. Their new album, [Araminta](http://sunnysidezone.com/album/araminta), featuring Wadada Leo Smith on trumpet was also released on Friday.**"**

+ ## Shabaka and the Ancestors - Natty
_Sanjay_: **"**I started delving more deeply into Shabaka’s projects after he shared Edward Said’s book, [Orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)), on Facebook. Throughout this album, the band’s two percussionists – Gontse Machine and Tumi Mogorosi – exploit a sheer melodic beauty with different drum patterns and speeds, making each piece sound part of the same project. Its aim, explains Shabaka, is ‘to present the musical language that [he] normally associate[s] with [his] UK bands in the context of South African musicians and musical sensibilities’.**"**

+ ## Dafnis Prieto Si O Si Quartet - Si O Si
_Sanjay_: **"**Fresh from a two-day residency at The Jazz Gallery in New York last week alongside [Henry Threadgill](https://www.pirecordings.com/artist/Henry_Threadgill) and [Vijay Iyer](http://vijay-iyer.com/), [Dafnis Prieto](https://dafnisonmusic.com/) is an impressive US-based drummer. This title track – recorded live at The Jazz Standard – is all polyrhythmic clings, claps, and clatters, rims and heads and muted cymbals with bassist Charles Flores picking up the vamp before Peter Apfelbaum’s offhandedly charismatic tenor.**"**
