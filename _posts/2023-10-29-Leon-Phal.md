# Leon Phal's selection

## Sugar Minott - One Step Ahead

**Leon Phal**: **"**If, like me, you need some time to be fully wake up in the morning, the sound of producer and multi instrumentist Victor Axelrod will help you to connect with your body and your new day.**"**

## Thesa - Mbawula

**Leon Phal**: **"**We need Spirituality in our life, period.

Max Herre delivered to the world an outstanding album called WEB MAX who features some legends as Yussef Lateef and Mulatu Astatke. This album is to me one of the best album of our “modern” times.
**"**

## The Producer's Workshop Ensemble - Got 2 Live

**Leon Phal**: **"**Did you hear something like that before ? If you do please send me references because this is WOW ! Spiritual jazz mixed with Hip Hop entirely produced in Japan during the first wave of the pendemic, please enjoy this viral groove**"**
