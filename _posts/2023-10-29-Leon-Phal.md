<p id="introduction">
	This morning, let's begin the day with a decidedly optimistic choice. Our guest, [Leon Phal](https://leonphal.bandcamp.com/album/stress-killer), demonstrates a profound understanding of what it means to embrace a "good vibe." He graciously introduces this episode with some incredibly elegant jazz that has the power to illuminate even the darkest of hearts. In these turbulent times, it's clear just how much we need this kind of positivity.
<br><br>
	One certainty remains: peace primarily hinges on our individual capacity to once again say "yes" to life. This, of course, requires courage and determination. So, we hope that this selection will infuse you with the courage and hope needed to face the challenges ahead. The future is a blank canvas waiting to be painted, so let's craft a remarkable story together. With love.

# Leon Phal's selection

## [Sugar Minott](https://victoraxelrod.bandcamp.com/album/if-you-ask-me-to-victor-axelrod-productions-for-daptone-records) - One Step Ahead

**Leon Phal**: **"**If, like me, you need some time to be fully wake up in the morning, the sound of producer and multi instrumentist Victor Axelrod will help you to connect with your body and your new day.**"**

## [Thesa](https://webweb.bandcamp.com/album/web-max) - Mbawula

**Leon Phal**: **"**We need Spirituality in our life, period.

Max Herre delivered to the world an outstanding album called WEB MAX who features some legends as Yussef Lateef and Mulatu Astatke. This album is to me one of the best album of our “modern” times.
**"**

## [The Producer's Workshop Ensemble](https://staythecourserecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-producers-workshop-ensemble-in-japan) - Got 2 Live

**Leon Phal**: **"**Did you hear something like that before ? If you do please send me references because this is WOW ! Spiritual jazz mixed with Hip Hop entirely produced in Japan during the first wave of the pendemic, please enjoy this viral groove**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Leon Phal](https://leonphal.bandcamp.com/album/stress-killer) - Idylla feat. K.O.G.

ImaCrea: **"**I can't recall the exact moment I stumbled upon Leon Phal's work, but what remains vivid in my memory is the immediate enchantment it sparked, especially by this particular track. The seamless flow and harmonious synergy among everyone on the stage are truly exceptional. While I have yet to witness his band perform live, I can only imagine it must be nothing short of extraordinary.**"**

## [Busty and the Bass](https://bustyandthebass.bandcamp.com/album/forever-never-cares) - All The Things I Couldn't Say To You

ImaCrea: **"**Instant classic.**"**

## [Endea Owens](https://endeaowens.bandcamp.com/album/feel-good-music) - Raven's Prayer

ImaCrea: **"**This selection is a subtle nod to Leon Phal's choice of Thesa, a profoundly spiritual track that holds a special place in my heart. It exudes a strength that stirs the depths of one's being, igniting the desire to take action and fulfill one's purpose.**"**

## [Holy Tongue](https://valentinamagaletti.bandcamp.com/) - A New God Before Us

ImaCrea: **"**What can I say? I have a deep appreciation for the work of Holy Tongue, and this track is from their freshly released debut album. I've had it on repeat and eagerly anticipated sharing it with you. I adore how it concludes the selection with a mesmerizing journey into the unknown, and what's equally enchanting is how the following track (if you're listening to the episode on a loop) seamlessly resonates with it, creating a flawless transition for an entire morning of continuous listening.**"**
