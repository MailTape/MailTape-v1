	This morning, amidst the harmonious convergence of sound and soul, accompanied by our guest, [Pavane](https://pavane.bandcamp.com), we invite you to embark on a transformative odyssey — a journey of self-discovery, introspection, and boundless creativity. As we traverse the vast landscapes of musical expression, may we find solace, inspiration, and the courage to embrace the beauty of the unknown.

# Pavane's selection

## Felix Rösch - Elegy for Peace 

**Pavane**: **"**I feel connected to this composer since the first solo piano pieces he released in 2020, especially a track called 'Berceuse.' His entire album 'Fragmente' is beautiful, very sensitive, and melodious. He is finding more and more interesting materials, like the glissando voices in this piece, which inspires me a lot.**"**

## Maria Teriaeva - The Jungle in June

**Pavane**: **"**Discovered thanks to the Maintenant festival in Rennes in October. I love the materials of modular synth that this composer develops. It works really well and it's very sonorous, very lively, animal. Her album 'Corservatory of Flowers' is one of my favorite albums of 2023. Synthetic fauna and flora. It feels like eating sound.**"**

## Fred Again & Brian Eno - Cmon

**Pavane**: **"**The album 'Secret Life' helped me feel less inhibited about releasing unfinished materials, which can be jewels for the ears, without necessarily seeking efficiency, but rather by putting us in an attitude of contemplation... to take the time to digest the sound proposals.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Pavane - Oboe

ImaCrea: **"**Pavane released his latest album, [Children](https://pavane.bandcamp.com/album/children), back in December. I've been listening to it at least once every week for the past two months. The composition, the texture... This track, "Oboe," is a classic Pavane signature; I could recognize his work instantly. I love how he manages to create aerial material that makes me feel as if I could fly, and how humble it sounds at the same time. Even though there's virtuosity in his work, the generosity of the artist makes it feel welcoming and warm for anyone. It takes a lot of courage and great engagement to create such work.**"**

## Ryuichi Sakamoto - Japan

ImaCrea: **"**I keep sharing my discoveries from my dig into Ryuichi Sakamoto's work. Here is a track from *Coda*, an album released in 1983. A very intimate album with less synth and pop and more rooted in contemporary classical influence. I see here material to reflect on with the previous track from Pavane; we also have something here akin to flying. It's just a different kind of bird. Or is it the act of breathing evoked by this ample repetition, growing and stretching alternately?**"**

## ANOHNI and the Johnsons - Sliver Of Ice

ImaCrea: **"**Fierce love and courage. We need more heroes like ANOHNI in our lives. An invitation to tear down our screens and take a real look around us. Fear is so widespread; let's cure it with love. Time to raise our flowers.**"**

## Comforter2 - Found It All

ImaCrea: **"**Proving I'm not a robot, proving we're not. Let's stay open to contrast and surprises. The lightness and joy in this track are deeply needed and reinvigorating. Birds rarely fly alone; let's form a flock and dance together for peace.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for being with us. **If you plan to be in Paris on march the 29th, book your evening as there's a suprise cooking...** Special thanks to [Pavane](https://pavane.bandcamp.com) for sharing his soulful selection. A huge shout-out to [Lucy Fléty](https://www.instagram.com/lucie.flety/) for her magical illustration perfectly fit for this selection! Until next Sunday, stay tuned.</p>
