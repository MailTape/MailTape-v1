<p id="introduction"> This morning, 
<br><br>

</p>


# Corey King's selection


## Benny Soebardja & Lizard - Candlelight
Corey King: **"**There are a few reasons I chose the Benny Soebarja & Lizard track. The first reason is I love how healing and relaxed the track starts out, super pleasant for morning activity. The second is the vocal. I always tend to gravitate towards both male and female husky vocalist. With a voice like that, you don't have to do much. I also just dig the lyrics and song form.**"**

## CAN - Mary, Mary, So Contrary
Corey King: **"**I can't list all the reasons I chose this record but i'll list a couple. First is the way CAN interacts with each other, they have a looseness and freedom that  I can definitely appreciate, I feel like I'm missing those aspects in music now. Second is Malcolm Mooney's raspy and girthy voice, another one who can just sing the melody and not have to do anything else. He's one of the few baritones I can hear sing all day.**"**

## ARP - Fluorescences
Corey King: **"**[ARP](https://arpetc.bandcamp.com/) is an artist I discovered a couple of years ago and I'm learning that this guy has been putting out records for quite some time now, everything I've heard is sweet. This track in particular just gets my ideas flowing and I love marimba. They did an incredible job recording the drums too.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Corey King](https://corey-king.bandcamp.com/) - 3 Years
Jules: **"****"**

## [Ratomagoson](https://www.facebook.com/ratomagoson/) - Poolside (feat. Sebastian Lopez Bustos)
Jules: **"****"**

## [Djrum](https://djrum.bandcamp.com/) - Sparrows
Jules: **"**Released in August 2018, "Portrait with Firewood" is Felix Manuel's most personal work to date. It's hard to choose a specific song from this album, as the British underground artist manages to mix his classical jazz influences with techno, ambient and dubstep sonorities to capture a broad range of emotions and feelings, from violence to pure beauty. This one seems perfect for a slow and sweet awakening.**"**

## BEA1991 - the dream
Jules: **"**I discovered [BEA1991](https://bea1991.bandcamp.com/) as she performed for the opening act of Blood Orange's concert at Élysée Montmartre in July, the same day her first album "Brand New Adult" was released. It was only her and her computer, and at some time she left the stage and continued to sing while walking through the crowd. As this was her final song, she invited everyone to sit on the floor around her to share this dreamy feeling. I still feel very special when I remember this.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Thank you so much for joining us. Much love and respect to [Corey King](https://corey-king.bandcamp.com/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for this episode's cool illustration. </p>
