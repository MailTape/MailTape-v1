<p id="introduction"> This morning, we celebrate the very last days of summer in pleasant company, with London's mysterious cumbia collective [Malphino](https://malphino.bandcamp.com/).
<br><br>
Malphino's name is a combination of the original members’ respective nationalities: ‘Mal’ bridges David’s Malaysian origins with Alex’s Phillipino-‘Phino’- roots. In 2010, the two joined Japanese percussionist Yu Sato on accordion and tuba during his obscure Latin-oriented nights organized at the Haggerston, in the east of London, where they would re-imagine Latin tunes and interpret Italian film soundtracks. While the regular event gathered a small community of musicians, the initial abstract concept of Malphino, as an outer-national, mystical band coming from an imaginary tropical island, was born. 
The collective of diaspora musicians and visual artists has also created a colourful image which complement the fantastic and playful vision created by their sound.

# Corey King's selection


## Benny Soebardja & Lizard - Candlelight
Corey King: **"**There are a few reasons I chose the Benny Soebarja & Lizard track. The first reason is I love how healing and relaxed the track starts out, super pleasant for morning activity. The second is the vocal. I always tend to gravitate towards both male and female husky vocalist. With a voice like that, you don't have to do much. I also just dig the lyrics and song form.**"**

## CAN - Mary, Mary, So Contrary
Corey King: **"**I can't list all the reasons I chose this record but i'll list a couple. First is the way CAN interacts with each other, they have a looseness and freedom that  I can definitely appreciate, I feel like I'm missing those aspects in music now. Second is Malcolm Mooney's raspy and girthy voice, another one who can just sing the melody and not have to do anything else. He's one of the few baritones I can hear sing all day.**"**

## [ARP](https://arpetc.bandcamp.com/) - Fluorescences
Corey King: **"**ARP is an artist I discovered a couple of years ago and I'm learning that this guy has been putting out records for quite some time now, everything I've heard is sweet. This track in particular just gets my ideas flowing and I love marimba. They did an incredible job recording the drums too.**"**

## [BEA1991](https://bea1991.bandcamp.com/) - the dream
Jules: **"**I discovered BEA1991 as she performed for the opening act of Blood Orange's concert at Élysée Montmartre in July, the same day her first album "Brand New Adult" was released. It was only her and her computer, and at some time she left the stage and started to sing while walking through the crowd. As this was her final song, she invited everyone to sit on the floor around her to share this dreamy feeling. I still feel very special when I remember this.**"**
