<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are delighted to welcome [Corey King](https://corey-king.bandcamp.com/) to select three inspiring Sunday morning tunes for us. The New-York-based multi-instrumentist has recently released a new album, "[A Loveless Sunken Sun](https://corey-king.bandcamp.com/album/a-loveless-sunken-sun)", he describes as "a testament to the power of angst to foster growth".
<br><br>
Produced over two years in near solitude in Brooklyn and while on the road, this record sees the Texas-born musician taking a more experimental route than his previous projects. Featuring synths, drum machines and programming alongside live band characteristics, King evokes the personal anxieties born during these two years that saw him facing the extremities of life in the birth of a son and the loss of his grandmother while he was touring the world.

# Corey King's selection


## Benny Soebardja & Lizard - Candlelight
Corey King: **"**There are a few reasons I chose the Benny Soebarja & Lizard track. The first reason is I love how healing and relaxed the track starts out, super pleasant for morning activity. The second is the vocal. I always tend to gravitate towards both male and female husky vocalist. With a voice like that, you don't have to do much. I also just dig the lyrics and song form.**"**

## CAN - Mary, Mary, So Contrary
Corey King: **"**I can't list all the reasons I chose this record but i'll list a couple. First is the way CAN interacts with each other, they have a looseness and freedom that  I can definitely appreciate, I feel like I'm missing those aspects in music now. Second is Malcolm Mooney's raspy and girthy voice, another one who can just sing the melody and not have to do anything else. He's one of the few baritones I can hear sing all day.**"**

## ARP - Fluorescences
Corey King: **"**[ARP](https://arpetc.bandcamp.com/) is an artist I discovered a couple of years ago and I'm learning that this guy has been putting out records for quite some time now, everything I've heard is sweet. This track in particular just gets my ideas flowing and I love marimba. They did an incredible job recording the drums too.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Corey King - 3 Years
Jules: **"**3 years is the time that has passed since the release of Corey King's last album "Lashes". Diverging from the indie rock sounds of his beginnings, this song creates a complex and rich universe which embodies well King's development as a more experimental songwriter and producer. **"**

## [Ratomagoson](https://www.facebook.com/ratomagoson/) - Poolside (feat. Sebastián López Bustos)
Jules: **"**This song featuring saxophonist Sebastián López Bustos is taken from Ratomagoson's last release "[Resin](https://shop.nudibranchrecords.uk/album/resin)". His signature perc cuts and bass smoothly melts with synths and López's sax to create an enigmatic but blissful atmosphere.**"**

## [Djrum](https://djrum.bandcamp.com/) - Sparrows
Jules: **"**Released in August 2018, "Portrait with Firewood" is Felix Manuel's most personal work to date. It's hard to choose a specific song from this album, as the British underground artist manages to mix his classical jazz influences with techno, ambient and dubstep sonorities to capture a broad range of emotions and feelings, from violence to pure beauty. This one is perfect for a slow and sweet awakening.**"**

## BEA1991 - the dream
Jules: **"**I discovered [BEA1991](https://bea1991.bandcamp.com/) as she performed for the opening act of Blood Orange's concert at Élysée Montmartre in July, the same day her first album "Brand New Adult" was released. It was only her and her computer, and at some time she left the stage and continued to sing while walking through the crowd. As this was her final song, she invited everyone to sit on the floor around her to share this dreamy feeling. I still feel very special when I remember this.**"**
