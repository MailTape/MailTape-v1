<p id="introduction">This morning, let's enjoy the comeback of sunnier days while listening to [Cut Off Your Hands](https://www.facebook.com/cutoffyourhands/ "Facebook")’ kaleidoscopic selection. Cut Off Your Hands' dreamy yet energetic tracks combine cheerful indie rock with post punk influences, always feeling very sincere. </p>
<p>Open your windows, put on your sunglasses, make yourself a nice coffee, and get ready for a fulfilling day with their selection! All Sundays do not have to be lazy.</p>



# **Cut Off Your Hands’ selection**

+ ## LA Priest - Lorry Park
_Cut Off Your Hands_: **"**This magical nature of the sounds and the progression through the song inspires action... this song commands something to happen. I usually like to do have an active Sunday and get stuff done like housework, errands, shopping, etc - so this track is the perfect call to action. I'm a fan of Sam's collaborations, the latest with Connan Mockasin called Soft Hair.**"**

+ ## John Coltrane - Blue Train
_Cut Off Your Hands_: **"**How good is jazz? That's rhetorical, everyone knows. Beautiful interplay between each instrument and excellent arrangement, with plenty of space throughout. Especially good on a Sunday as it's the day when I reflect on the week that's been and begin to ponder the one to come. Oh so saxy!**"**

+ ## Flamingosis - Bright Moments (ft. The Kount)
_Cut Off Your Hands_: **"**I've been following Flamingosis for a few years now and has continued to produce tasty tunes, this one being the title track off an album release in July of this year. I often listen to old soul/funk (Al Green, Rick Holmes etc) and Flamingosis adds a fresh flavour with mixes between Hip Hop & Funk, sampling some of my favourite artists. If you dig this tune, next take a listen to 'what went wrong?'.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Cut Off Your Hands - Higher Lows and Lower Highs
_Inès_: **"**After a few years without any releases, Cut Off Your Hands decided to gift us with two new songs, and I couldn’t be happier about it since it is a band I have been listening to for years. « Higher Lows and Lower Highs » is one of them, referring to mental health issues and their impact on life yet having this funky, upbeat sound that is so difficult to resist.**"** 

+ ## BABE - Scooping Pints
_Inès_: **"**Let's continue in this groovy vibe with BABE's song, making us travel to a tropical island, under a blazing sun, chilling and/or dancing, simply enjoying life.**"**

+ ## Aquaserge - Tour du Monde
_Inès_: **"**Aquaserge is a French band mixing so many influences it’s hard to explain the kind of music they’re playing. « Tour du monde », taken from their latest release « Laisse ça être », feels like listening to a conversation between all its instruments. Who’s going to have the final say in this?**"**

+ ## Caandides - Rio
_Inès_: **"**« Rio » is my go-to song every time a ray of sunshine appears for more than two seconds. I love its structure, alternating turbulent moments with calmer ones, letting you breathe in between. It just overall feels carefree and optimistic, perfect for busy sunny days!**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [Cut Off Your Hands](https://www.facebook.com/cutoffyourhands/ "Facebook") for their participation, and Anais for the illustration. Have a delightful Sunday! </p>
