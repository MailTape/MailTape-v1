<p id="introduction">This morning, juggle the calm and energetic moments thrown your way by [Requin Chagrin](https://www.facebook.com/chagrin.requin/ "Facebook")’s eclectic selection. Requin Chagrin, a French band born from singer Marion’s mind, mixes surf-ish reverb guitars with a melancholic vibe, creating a warm and languid sound.</p>
<p>During this precisely 30-minute selection, travel through France, Norway, the US and the UK, feel both warmth and coldness, take a few breaths and dance (alone) in your room. Sunnier days don’t seem that far away now.</p>


# **Cut Off Your Hands’ selection**

+ ## Flamingosis - Bright Moments (fr. The Kount)
_Cut Off Your Hands_: **"**I've been following Flamingosis for a few years now and has continued to produce tasty tunes, this one being the title track off an album release in July of this year. I often listen to old soul/funk (Al Green, Rick Holmes etc) and Flamingosis adds a fresh flavour with mixes between Hip Hop & Funk, sampling some of my favourite artists. If you dig this tune, next take a listen to 'what went wrong?'.**"**

+ ## John Coltrane - Blue Train
_Cut Off Your Hands_: **"**How good is jazz? That's rhetorical, everyone knows. Beautiful interplay between each instrument and excellent arrangement, with plenty of space throughout. Especially good on a Sunday as it's the day when I reflect on the week that's been and begin to ponder the one to come. Oh so saxy!**"**

+ ## LA Priest - Lorry Park
_Yohann from Requin Chagrin_: **"**This magical nature of the sounds and the progression through the song inspires action... this song commands something to happen. I usually like to do have an active Sunday and get stuff done like housework, errands, shopping, etc - so this track is the perfect call to action. I'm a fan of Sam's collaborations, the latest with Connan Mockasin called Soft Hair.**"**
