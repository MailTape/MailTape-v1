<p id="introduction">This morning, take some time to listen to [Le Turc Mécanique](https://www.facebook.com/leturcmecanique/)'s delightful selection, for a morning that gets sweeter by every minute.<br>
Post-punk label [Le Turc Mécanique](https://www.facebook.com/leturcmecanique/), created by Charles Crost in 2012, is one of France's best independent labels, with artists ranging from pop to post-punk to noise to techno and more.
<br>So even though autumn and its grey skies have arrived, it doesn't mean we have to wallow in self pity. It takes a little less than 30 minutes to go from bleakness to comfort.</p>


# Le Turc Mécanique's selection


## Colombey - La dernière 8.6 de la ville
_Le Turc Mécanique_: **"**Colombey’s latest LP has been released very recently, but it’s been many years that it's been listened to on loop on Sunday mornings. Mornings after you have not slept, when you are safely cloistered in your flat that has become gloomy, now silent and rigid, facing the music of this guy who tells you word-for-word what we are thinking. Of course, it won’t be easily understandable for English speakers, but I think that his way of singing can be quite self-explanatory.**"**

## Nina Harker - Crepuscùlo
_Le Turc Mécanique_: **"**Indispensable, invincible and tireless: 'Crepuscùlo' is certainly the best pop song written in France since I've been there. An amazing reinterpretation of the feeling of Spanish pop (no clichés here) with bird noises, 80's shrieking guitar, slippery synth, a [Solid Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Amcuyzd54s)-inspired sound — paralyzing. Moreover, it was the first release of an awesome label — le Syndicat des Scorpions — who have not been disappointing so far.**"**

## Sundae - Verano-Invierno
_Le Turc Mécanique_: **"**This Spanish pop is a guilty pleasure. They have a very different interpretation of this musical corpus compared to France, and a language that inevitably colours the tracks. Sundae was a band from Seville, brought to France mainly by Beko in the early 2010s. These guys are masters of post-hangover comfort music. I had the chance to meet Davis, their singer, who gave me a tour of Seville, and who I missed recently in Paris, like a big idiot. An adorable guy, much like his music.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jardin - Mon amour n'a pas de sexe
_Inès_: **"**It was hard for me to pick one song from Le Turc Mécanique’s artists because they are all so different yet so good. But my choice went for Jardin’s intense ‘Mon amour n’a pas de sexe’: its gloomy atmosphere just feels right at the moment.**"**

## Утро - Как Же Я Был Слаб В Те Дни
_Inès_: **"**I discovered this song maybe 6 or 7 years ago, and it’s been a staple in my life ever since. Catchy cold-wave that never gets old. Fun fact: Утро is Motorama’s group members’ side project (but maybe you already knew).**"**

## Police des Moeurs - Heure Bleue
_Inès_: **"**Just because I am in love with the « sense of impending doom » vibe that can be felt throughout the song. Beautiful.**"**

## Chris Rubeo - Lover's Spit
_Inès_: **"**Time for some softness to finish this episode. Part of [The Outs](http://www.theouts.com/)' soundtrack and a cover of the Broken Social Scene song '[Lover's Spit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK-91jT1f2E)', this song is just so comforting: slow, sweet synths mixed with a syrupy voice. Perfect to go back to sleep.**"**
