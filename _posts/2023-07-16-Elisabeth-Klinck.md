<p id="introduction">
	On this Sunday morning, let's venture far from the city with our guest, [Elisabeth Klinck](https://hallowground.bandcamp.com/album/elisabeth-klinck-picture-a-frame). This selection has been curated for wide open spaces, contemplation, and walking in unknown lands. It's an invitation to shift our gaze and let our attention drift as we immerse ourselves in the landscape.</p>

# Elisabeth Klinck's selection

##  Henrique Oswald - Sonata em Mi Maior para Violino e Piano, Op. 36. III. Paul Klinck, violin.

Elisabeth Klinck: **"**The first track features a recording of my father, an amazing violinist. Only recently I discovered he recorded a bunch of CD's before I was born. It made me feel so proud! This one is recorded in 1995, the year I was born. I'm obviously his biggest fan. 

My father has such a delicate and unique way of playing, he still practices every day. I basically woke up my whole life with him playing scales, which could be confronting since I wasn't always so keen on practicing scales.
Since I don't live with my parents anymore, it's now my alarm clock who greats me every morning with classical music.**"**

## Matthew Hayes & Charlie Perry - Dissolve

Elisabeth Klinck: **"**Recently, I downloaded this album just before I went on a super early flight from Harstad, a small village in Norway, all the way back to my home in Brussels. I hadn't been home for over a month.

Despite the hectic nature of flying, this album made me feel safe and cared for, it created a little cocoon.  It even resonated with the children who were far from feeling as sleepy as I was. (I don't own one of those noise-cancelling headphones)

I listened to the album on repeat, but unfortunately, at one point, my phone died and I just had to endure the rest of the journey with only the memory of that comforting state. **"**

## Aki - Eri

Elisabeth Klinck: **"**Aki is a band centered around the Belgian drummer, Anke Verslype, I had the pleasure of getting to know her through various free impro gigs. I often put it on when I start my day, it's amazing to wake up with.

The song features Joachim Badenhorst, a clarinetist/musician who's sound I truly admire.

I also just love the little voice in the beginning, you find yourself wondering, "What are they saying???" And then you forget about it, because it doesn't matter. It's just a little blue monster coming out of its cave and joyfully greeting the day with some sounds that lingered from its dreams. **"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Elisabeth Klinck](https://hallowground.bandcamp.com/album/elisabeth-klinck-picture-a-frame) - Betty's Nap

ImaCrea: "Following my discovery of Elisabeth Klinck, whose track "River" was selected by [The Humble Bee in episode 528](/528/the-humble-bee/), I listened to her debut album "Picture a Frame" repeatedly.

The unique atmosphere of this album feels like a nature stroll, like that moment when you veer off the beaten path and realize that the landscape is not just what you see, but the space in which you are immersed. And this track, which concludes the album, is perhaps the one that best reflects this intention for me.

To further explore this idea of intertwining, like a grand collage of soundscapes, I went outside and waited to see how this track resonated with the surrounding sounds. It was a way to hear a renewed and unique music unfold in that very moment."

## [KMRU](https://kmru.bandcamp.com/album/glim) - options

ImaCrea: "KMRU's music always intrigues me, and I can sense that it will require many more listens for me to unravel its mystery.

This track, "options," recently released on the album titled "glim," unfolds a variety of sounds that make me feel like my field of vision expands. Suddenly, I have the sensation of seeing as I hear, simultaneously in all directions. The immersion is complete, without needing any virtual reality headset.
"

## Claire Rousay - Sigh In My Ear

ImaCrea: "We're sticking with sound collage, but here we delve into more pop sounds with this guitar and vocals that instinctively remind me of Air, like in "Lost in Translation."

This track is from Claire Rousay's upcoming album, set to be released in August, and I'm really excited to hear what's next. The journey continues..."

## Lucie Antunes - Elliott

ImaCrea: "I'm going to take a detour here because it's too tempting to resist, and deep down, I am firmly convinced that this track embodies the energy I'm seeking.

Lucie Antunes' music calls for movement, and that's exactly where I'd like to take you to conclude this selection: to take one step, then another, and another. To traverse the landscape, be carried away by the rhythm, and let your walk transform into a dance."

<p id="outroduction">Thatâ€™s it for today, keep walking and let nature brings its music to you. Thanks for being with us, the future can be bright. Much love to [Elisabeth Klinck](https://hallowground.bandcamp.com/album/elisabeth-klinck-picture-a-frame) for her inspiring selection. And a big thanks to Julie for her smooth and lovely illustration. See you next Sunday.</p>
