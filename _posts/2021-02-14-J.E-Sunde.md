<p id="introduction">This morning, we sit down, we slow down time and we adopt a slow life. We enjoy the moment, the simple pleasures of life and reconnect with nature. It is accompanied by the music of J. E. Sunde that we embark on this slow sunday.
<br><br>
 It’s sincere, subtle, delicate and beautiful. So much to describe the music of Jonathan Edward Sunde. It is through his fourth album “9 Songs About Love” that this American from Wisconsin, seduces us with his folk-rock notes.

# J.E Sunde's selection

## Ladysmith Black Mambazo – Unomthemba 
J.E Sunde: **"**For years, if I have a Sunday morning where I can just drink coffee and read, I have played this record. In my humble opinion it is the perfect morning record. The whole thing is great and this is the opening track. Paul Simon produced the record after collaborating with Ladysmith on Graceland.**"**

## Paul Simon - Graceland
J.E Sunde: **"**Also for years, I’ve followed the Ladysmith record with Paul Simon’s Graceland record. It’s a bit more up beat but is still a pretty gentle way to start your day. The song “Graceland” is one of the great songs of all time on one of the great records of all time. Also, it has a killer opening line, “The Mississippi Delta is shining like a National guitar.**"**

## The Books  – The Lemon of Pink I
J.E Sunde: **"**This last year I found myself really connecting with this record in the morning. Again, this is the opening track of the record that I suggest playing all the way through. Their combination of found, acoustic, electronic and manipulated sounds is incredible to me. Their pieces are at times such a jumbled collage and yet they achieve this intimacy and feeling that is really something.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## J.E Sunde – Sunset Trip
Anaïs G: **"**Dans son quatrième album "9 Songs About Love", sorti sur label français Vietnam, ce qui m'a touché c'est cette musique folk-rock, oscillant parfois entre nostalgie et mélancolie, mais toujours avec cette bon humeur assumée. A écouter en trainant sous la couette, avec le petit-déjeuner qui va avec !  **"**

## Withney – No Woman
Anaïs G: **"** **"**

## Nadia Reid – Other Side of the Wheel
Anaïs G: **"** **"**

## Lomelda – Columbia River
Anaïs G: **"** **"**
