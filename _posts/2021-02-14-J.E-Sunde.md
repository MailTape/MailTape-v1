<p id="introduction">This morning, 
<br><br>

</p>


# J.E Sunde's selection

## Ladysmith Black Mambazo – Unomthemba 
J.E Sunde: **"**For years, if I have a Sunday morning where I can just drink coffee and read, I have played this record. In my humble opinion it is the perfect morning record. The whole thing is great and this is the opening track. Paul Simon produced the record after collaborating with Ladysmith on Graceland.**"**

## Paul Simon - Graceland
J.E Sunde: **"**Also for years, I’ve followed the Ladysmith record with Paul Simon’s Graceland record. It’s a bit more up beat but is still a pretty gentle way to start your day. The song “Graceland” is one of the great songs of all time on one of the great records of all time. Also, it has a killer opening line, “The Mississippi Delta is shining like a National guitar.**"**

## The Books  – The Lemon of Pink I
J.E Sunde: **"**This last year I found myself really connecting with this record in the morning. Again, this is the opening track of the record that I suggest playing all the way through. Their combination of found, acoustic, electronic and manipulated sounds is incredible to me. Their pieces are at times such a jumbled collage and yet they achieve this intimacy and feeling that is really something.**"**
