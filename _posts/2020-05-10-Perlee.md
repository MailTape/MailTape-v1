# Perlee's selection

## Easter Parade - The Blue Nile
Saramai & Cormac: **"**Paul Buchanan has one of those voices that cut to the core and you know he means everything he is singing. The Blue Nile mainly do night-time kind of songs but Easter Parade has Sunday all over it for us. Their emotional landscapes have been a massive influence. They have a way of creating a mood and sweeping you away with it. This song is full of poetic observation, nostalgic recollections and as always with The Blue Nile, a sense of immense space - all of which we felt was apt listening for these isolationist times!**"**

## LaVern Baker - Lucky Old Sun
Saramai: **"**I got a gift of a LaVerne Baker album from my brother one Christmas and she became a staple on the stereo. Perfect Sunday morning listening and her version of Lucky Old Sun is masterful, her tone, dynamic - it's astounding. You always feel better after hearing LaVern sing.**"**

## O Emperor - Land of the Living
Saramai & Cormac: **"**For when Saturday night runs in Sunday morning! We are big fans of O Emperor. They are an Irish band who recently won the Choice Prize, the Irish equivalent of the Mercury awards. They have since broken up but each member is going on to do different musical things. They bring elements of krautrock, psych and funk together in a masterful way. We have often driven many miles to catch them live. This song is from a stunning record called 'In Vitreous'. Their drummer Brendan Fennessy played on one of our tracks which was a buzz for us. They were always under appreciated until they won the Choice but by that stage they had already disbanded. It's a great story and they have left a brilliant legacy. It will be exciting to see what they each get up to next.**"**
