<p id="introduction">This morning, our playlist curated with [Kid Francescoli](https://www.facebook.com/kidfrancescoli) is like a perennial river as it is meant to flow round the clock. The first track serves as a point of origin. And subsequently, the second track is where the river determines its course. There comes a point where it slows down and rests as Chet Baker’s “Almost Blow” tunes in. But then, gradually gravitates towards its primal state—which is where “Blow up” by Francescoli, unfurls its mystery. And keeps the playlist flowing until it immerses in the ocean.</p>

# Kid Francescoli's morning inspiration

## Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros - 40 Day Dream (Turbotito Remix)
_Kid Francescoli:_ **"**For sunny and happy sundays. It instantly makes me wanna get out of bed and start planning a lot of things to have fun all through the day.
Be careful at what you play right after because it might ruin this positive feeling.**"**

## KZA - Vous Dansez
_Kid Francescoli:_ **"**It goes perfectly with the well-known sunday melancoly.
It's very cinematographic and a little groovy, which is all I would like to do with music.
It has this power to put you in another world, where you can stay all sunday long if you play this loop song on loop.**"**

## Chet Baker - Almost Blue
_Kid Francescoli:_ **"**For sundays where you just have enough energy to get up, put some music and go back to bed.
Then you can spend the rest of the day in bed without having lost your sunday.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! A big thank to our guest [Kid Francescoli](https://www.facebook.com/kidfrancescoli) and their great morning selection.
Enjoy your sunday.
