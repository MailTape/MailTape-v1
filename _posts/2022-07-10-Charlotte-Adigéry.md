<p id="introduction"> Our 500th episode of MailTape this morning!! We've had so many delightful guests this year and since 2012.

Bolis's intricate producing surprises listeners with each sortie, stretching from creative sampling to layered snythwork to punchy basslines. His production tells stories in its own right, evolving with every release.

# Bolis Pupul's selection

## [Beck](https://www.beck.com/) - Devil's Haircut
Bolis Pupul: **"**I vividly remember Beck playing “Devils Haircut” in 1997 at T/W festival in Belgium. That’s when I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life (age 11): make music.**"**

## [Armando](https://www.discogs.com/artist/870-Armando) - Don't Take It
Bolis Pupul: **"**A song that would take me straight to the dancefloor. Dave (from DEEWEE/Soulwax/2manydj's) actually introduced me to this track when we were writing "Thank You" off our record - he suggested we'd give it a listen, in particular to how the 303 was used.**"**

## [Prince](https://www.officialprincemusic.com/) - Sign of the Times
Bolis Pupul: **"**In my opinion Prince is the best artist ever. I wish I had written this song myself... just so good.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul](https://charlotteandbolis.com/) - Reappropriate
Sarah: **"**The namesake for Bolis Pupul's recent EP release. The synthwork here tells so many stories, brushing traditional Chinese melodies and new wave movements. Bolis Pupul's attempt to examine his Chinese heritage and identity in modern times plays out so beautifully in this release. The track was inspired by Bolis's dream of a Buddha constructed of neon lights.**"**

## [Underground System](https://heavenlysweetness.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-fire-ep) - Desnuda
Sarah: **"**Really enjoying this track off of (NY based) Underground System's latest EP, Into the Fire (2022). Desnuda was remixed by Yuksek recently, but nothing beats these easy grooves in the original.**"**

## [Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul](https://charlotteandbolis.com/) - It Hit Me
Sarah: **"**An example of the harrowing, but at times humorous, commentary in the debut album of Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul; a difficult balance to strike. Could listen to this track ten times and always find something new to enjoy about the production -- the deadpan vocal samples, the punchy percussives, the deep hitting bass... the track evolves before your ears, whether it's your first or seventh time listening through it.**"**

## [Walter Astral](https://morsels.website/) - L'eau
Sarah: **"**The latest release from Walter Astral. Love the traditional sitar, rock guitar, and synth layering, all these work in surprising harmony together. An interesting listen that builds upon itself, a vibrant finish to this playlist :)**"**
