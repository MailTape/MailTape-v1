# Bolis Pupul's selection

## [Erykah Badu](https://www.beck.com/) - Bag Lady
Bolis Pupul: **"**One of my all-time favorites. I finally saw her live right before the pandemic... I forgot about my body and felt connected to everybody in the audience and on stage. En Erykah Badu is funny as hell, you could see she was having fun.**"**

## [The Slits](https://www.discogs.com/artist/870-Armando) - Typical Girls
Bolis Pupul: **"**When I first sat down with Bolis in the studio he asked me if there was something that inspired me at that very moment. I played him The Slits and he also loved them. I told Bolis I didn't necessarily want to make post-punk music, but it’s more the approach to music, which was very childlike, playful, and intuitive.**"**

## [Talking Heads](https://www.officialprincemusic.com/) - Born Under Punches
Bolis Pupul: **"**I absolutely love David Byrne and everything he does. His "Stop Making Sense" documentary actually served as an inspiration for our song "Making Sense Stop."**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul](https://charlotteandbolis.com/) - Reappropriate
Sarah: **"**The namesake for Bolis Pupul's recent EP release. The synthwork here tells so many stories, brushing traditional Chinese melodies and new wave movements. Bolis Pupul's attempt to examine his Chinese heritage and identity in modern times plays out so beautifully in this release. The track was inspired by Bolis's dream of a Buddha constructed of neon lights.**"**

## [Underground System](https://heavenlysweetness.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-fire-ep) - Desnuda
Sarah: **"**Really enjoying this track off of (NY based) Underground System's latest EP, Into the Fire (2022). Desnuda was remixed by Yuksek recently, but nothing beats these easy grooves in the original.**"**

## [Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul](https://charlotteandbolis.com/) - It Hit Me
Sarah: **"**An example of the harrowing, but at times humorous, commentary in the debut album of Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul; a difficult balance to strike. Could listen to this track ten times and always find something new to enjoy about the production -- the deadpan vocal samples, the punchy percussives, the deep hitting bass... the track evolves before your ears, whether it's your first or seventh time listening through it.**"**

## [Walter Astral](https://morsels.website/) - L'eau
Sarah: **"**The latest release from Walter Astral. Love the traditional sitar, rock guitar, and synth layering, all these work in surprising harmony together. An interesting listen that builds upon itself, a vibrant finish to this playlist :)**"**
