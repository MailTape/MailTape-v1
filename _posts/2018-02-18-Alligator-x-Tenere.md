<p id="introduction">This morning is special, you are going to listen to our 300th episode. Today's release represent a high point in the MailTape adventure which marks 6 years dedicated to sharing with you the very best of our music discoveries each Sunday morning in the name of music, love and inspiration.</p>
  
In order to celebrate this milestone in the history of our collective, we set up yesterday night the [first edition of MailTape Live](https://www.facebook.com/events/324160978078937/) in Paris at the Popup!. Knowing most of you couldn't be there as our episodes are listened all around the world, find here a selection curated in collaboration with our two featured guests from yesterday night: [Alligator](https://www.facebook.com/alligator.musique/) and [Ténéré](https://www.facebook.com/teneremusic/).


# 300th SPECIAL EDITION

## Alessi Brothers - Seabird
_Alligator_: **"**It's the perfect song for Sunday night blues**"**

## Jef Ellise Barbara - A Perfect Day
_Alligator_: **"**Ideal hit for a Sunday alarm clock**"**

## Alligator - Belembra
_ImaCrea_: **"**Sunny pop wave to mark your first day at the beach... put on your bikini, jump on your bed, dance with the Sun.**"**

## Kadhja Bonet - This Love
_Ténéré_: **"**It's almost become a habit for me to listen to this song when I wake up. The lightness and sweetness of his voice can not better accompany a bed outing.**"**

## Quasimoto - Broad Factor
_Ténéré_: **"**No time to fool, the groove of Madlib can restore the motor functions of the body to go to the coffee.**"**

## Ténéré - Tenebris
_ImaCrea_: **"**The search for perfection pushed by a boundless idealism. The struggle for spiritual growth in a world dominated by materialism and violence. Music is a religion and Ténéré is on the way to join the league of its most inspiring preachers.**"**

## Shadow - Let's Get It Together
_ImaCrea_: **"**Lightness, freedom... Such track should be in some kind of museum as a symbol of the beauty humans can bring to the world and inspire society to keep creating with love and not rely solely on rational thinking spoiled by economic pressure.**"**

<p id="outroduction">Thanks to you, you and you! By your presence and your kind words, you are giving us the energy to keep running. Have a great Sunday full of inspiration and love.</p>
