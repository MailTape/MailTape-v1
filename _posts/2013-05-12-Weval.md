# Welcome to a new world

Landing was rather hectic but you're all safe and sound. A bit shy, you reach and open the decompression airlock. Underneath your eyes, an extraordinary show seemingly out of this world has presented itself. A yet untouched, strange and austere world lays ahead. The intensity of the moment is nothing but tangible. Your foot touches the ground, welcome to planet Weval.

# Weval's selection:

## Trentemøller - State Trooper
_Weval_:**"**For the people who didn't sleep at all and just found out it's sunday morning already.**"**

## Portishead - The Rip
_Weval_:**"**For the people who are going to sleep but want to play one last song.**"**

## Tame Impala - Solitude is Bliss (Mickey Moonlight Remix)
_Weval_:**"**For the people who didn't party and just woke up, full of energy.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Weval](https://www.facebook.com/wevalmusic/) for their selection, we hope you enjoyed the journey!</p>
