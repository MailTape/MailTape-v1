# Back in the groove

What is about sounds that deeply and instantly touch our souls? Their effect can vary from being mind-numbing to mind-awakening. Some tend to evoke emotionally charged memories whereas others simply lead you by the hand, as if you’re a child, into a void. The void is deep and one can’t simply fathom the emptiness inside it. So with blindfolded eyes, you tread into this long but intermittent path guided by the frequencies of sounds, particularly, induced by the synth.  And this is how you form a connection and “Recover” with Rival Consoles from whatever it is that your mind, body and soul needs to temporarily retire from. 

Clark’s hours conjures up the perfect winter imagery. It starts with me staring at my own image,but instead of me reflecting on myself, the mirror is the one that reaches out to me first. The looking glass, still holding my gaze slips me into an alternate world: a walk down a memory lane. This is where I see a child unwrapping a gift on a cold wintry morning; the outpouring of snow and the flakes resting on window panes. I open the window and hold my hand out; wreaths of flakes now falling on my hands, silenced by their own light weight... “What a wonderful touch,” I wonder, one that can only be felt in the split of a second. The next moment, it ends and like the shatter of a glass, the imagery too, fragments into time leaving me with nothing to embrace but a photograph.
