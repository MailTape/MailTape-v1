<p id="introduction">This Sunday, we welcome [The Growth Eternal](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape for a selection of soulful and psychedelic tracks to draw you out of bed this morning :) Based in New York City, [79.5](https://79point5.bandcamp.com) is headed by vocalist and pianist Kate Mattison. The group’s releases tread into spaces of jazz, disco, rock, and funk; making straightforward descriptions of the group difficult to put into words :) 
  
  new spaces of harmonies 
  melting into the film of these structures 
  vocals and instrumental bodings 
  bodies of sound 
<br><br>
79.5's rousing selections, carefully chosen for you, are songs frozen in time: immune to the rushing world around us and taking tender root within our hearts.</p>

# The Growth Eternal's selection

## Jon Bap - Born Into This
The Growth Eternal: **"**I love this song because it resonates with me on a lot of levels: The lyrics are deeply spiritual, the groove is deeply Dallas, and the overall feeling sums up the off-kilter era of my life when I found it in college.**"**

## Led Zeppelin - When the Levee Breaks
The Growth Eternal: **"**I used to play in a blues band in my hometown of Tulsa, OK, and without knowing it, it was part of the start of my journey to connect with my roots. Of course, nothing makes me feel more prideful of my African-American semi-Southern heritage than British white dudes playing the blues.**"**

## Erykah Badu - Other Side of the Game
The Growth Eternal: **"**My mom used to play Baduizm -every-single-time- that we would clean. I hated the work, but loved the music. I picked this track specifically because of the deeply human narrative. love you mama <3**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [The Growth Eternal](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/)  – Predictions
Sarah: **"**This track is the namesake for 79.5's 2018 album, [Predictions](https://79point5.bandcamp.com/album/predictions). As 79.5 explains, this track was cut live to tape, capturing the magic of live performance. The beginning sets us off with such a flowing soul in these chords and verses, a whole mood is created effortlessly. The spiraling flute takes the track to new heights, leaning the track into the psychedelic expressions of the 70's.**"**

## [Lynda Dawn](https://lyndadawn.bandcamp.com/) [Mndsgn](https://mndsgn.bandcamp.com/) Remix – Fonk Street
Sarah: **"**Obsessed with this track's progression, it spins Lynda Dawn's [original](https://lyndadawn.bandcamp.com/album/at-first-light) (charming in its own right) funk-psychedelic track into something cosmic and haunting, especially once [Mndsgn](https://mndsgn.bandcamp.com/) isolates Dawn's celestial vocals. The bass deepens the background's comeback and makes the return of sound even more powerful. This track's chosen color is trippy for a reason ;)"**"**

## [79.5](https://79point5.bandcamp.com/) [Tall Black Guy](https://tallblackguy.bandcamp.com/?search_item_id=3287062061&search_item_type=b&search_match_part=%3F&search_page_id=1659098101&search_page_no=1&search_rank=2&search_sig=a0425670910d90f25c51b7cba90bc21b) Bounce Remix – Terrorize My Heart
Sarah: **"**The drums in this!! 79.5 describes this track as a goodbye to an ex lover-- where after leaving, all she wanted was to dance. This remix certainly feels like an homage to that state of mind, the vocals flow together like silk and the synth movement is absolutely contagious. Love the pause and attention paid to the flute accents, such a cool melding of sound. **"**

## [James & Bobby Purify](https://www.discogs.com/artist/391184-James-Bobby-Purify) – I Don't Want to Have to Wait
Sarah: **"**Recently heard this track sampled on a [Kelly Finnigan](https://kellyfinnigan.bandcamp.com/album/the-tales-people-tell) release and was delighted :) There's such robust nostalgia in songs like this; time never changes them. You remember exactly where you were when you first heard it, and for the three minutes that it plays, it's like you never left.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for listening with us. So much love to [79.5](https://79point5.bandcamp.com/) for their fantastic Sunday selections and to [Jason Pridham](https://www.instagram.com/grancharismo/) for this episode's psychedelic illustration :)</p>
