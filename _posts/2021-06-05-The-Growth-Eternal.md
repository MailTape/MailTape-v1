<p id="introduction">This Sunday, we welcome [The Growth Eternal](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape for an eclectic collection to jumpstart your morning :) Based in Los Angeles, [The Growth Eternal](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/) is headed by multi-instrumentalist Byron Crenshaw. 
  The Growth Eternal pushes into new worlds of experimental music, melting the film of traditional song structures. In carefully complex harmonies, The Growth Eternal creates unexpected spaces to step through. Each album is crafted with intention, now growing into more spiritual expanses.

# The Growth Eternal's selection

## Jon Bap - Born Into This
The Growth Eternal: **"**I love this song because it resonates with me on a lot of levels: The lyrics are deeply spiritual, the groove is deeply Dallas, and the overall feeling sums up the off-kilter era of my life when I found it in college.**"**

## Led Zeppelin - When the Levee Breaks
The Growth Eternal: **"**I used to play in a blues band in my hometown of Tulsa, OK, and without knowing it, it was part of the start of my journey to connect with my roots. Of course, nothing makes me feel more prideful of my African-American semi-Southern heritage than British white dudes playing the blues.**"**

## Erykah Badu - Other Side of the Game
The Growth Eternal: **"**My mom used to play Baduizm -every-single-time- that we would clean. I hated the work, but loved the music. I picked this track specifically because of the deeply human narrative. love you mama <3**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [The Growth Eternal](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/)  – VII. Ghalani
Sarah: **"**Looking over his albums, Byron describes feeling special closeness to this one from the album Bass Tone Paintings. **"**

## [Lynda Dawn](https://lyndadawn.bandcamp.com/) [Mndsgn](https://mndsgn.bandcamp.com/) Remix – Fonk Street
Sarah: **"**Obsessed with this track's progression, it spins Lynda Dawn's [original](https://lyndadawn.bandcamp.com/album/at-first-light) (charming in its own right) funk-psychedelic track into something cosmic and haunting, especially once [Mndsgn](https://mndsgn.bandcamp.com/) isolates Dawn's celestial vocals. The bass deepens the background's comeback and makes the return of sound even more powerful. This track's chosen color is trippy for a reason ;)"**"**

## [79.5](https://79point5.bandcamp.com/) [Tall Black Guy](https://tallblackguy.bandcamp.com/?search_item_id=3287062061&search_item_type=b&search_match_part=%3F&search_page_id=1659098101&search_page_no=1&search_rank=2&search_sig=a0425670910d90f25c51b7cba90bc21b) Bounce Remix – Terrorize My Heart
Sarah: **"**The drums in this!! 79.5 describes this track as a goodbye to an ex lover-- where after leaving, all she wanted was to dance. This remix certainly feels like an homage to that state of mind, the vocals flow together like silk and the synth movement is absolutely contagious. Love the pause and attention paid to the flute accents, such a cool melding of sound. **"**

## [James & Bobby Purify](https://www.discogs.com/artist/391184-James-Bobby-Purify) – I Don't Want to Have to Wait
Sarah: **"**Recently heard this track sampled on a [Kelly Finnigan](https://kellyfinnigan.bandcamp.com/album/the-tales-people-tell) release and was delighted :) There's such robust nostalgia in songs like this; time never changes them. You remember exactly where you were when you first heard it, and for the three minutes that it plays, it's like you never left.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for listening with us. So much love to [79.5](https://79point5.bandcamp.com/) for their fantastic Sunday selections and to [Jason Pridham](https://www.instagram.com/grancharismo/) for this episode's psychedelic illustration :)</p>
