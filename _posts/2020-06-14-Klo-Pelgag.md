<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome [Michal Turtle](https://soundcloud.com/music-from-memory/mfm-mix-010-michal-turtle) to select three Sunday morning tunes with us—a musician and producer who spent the heart of the 1980s making subtle, enlightened music. 
<br><br>
Combining vocals with the dreamiest electro-jazz, balmy ambient dub and languid grooves, Michal Turtle's music feels entirely appropriate for these unseasonably warm and breezy days.

# Klô Pelgag's selection

## Rufus Wainwright - Cigarettes and chocolate milk
Klô Pelgag: **"**Recently, I have created a morning playlist of carefully selected songs. Songs that would, in my opinion, perfectly embrace this particular time of day: the morning. In this playlist, this song by Rufus always makes an immediate effect on me. It makes me want to get up with my coffee and sing the (little-known) lyrics. Rufus' songs have that 'musical comedy' side, he always seems to be -on the edge of a big cliff with waves crashing on the rock, arms in the air- when he sings.**"**

## Elliot Smith - Angeles
Klô Pelgag: **"**There's something about Elliott Smith's music that makes it super joyful when you feel good and super sad when you feel bad. When I listen to this song in the morning, whether it's sunny or grey, it calms me instantly. It's an artist I discovered late in my teens and loved effortlessly. Instantly. I love his greasy hair and his melancholy, even though I wished he was happy. But he probably wouldn't have made this music I like so much if he had. It's weird, though, to appreciate someone's sadness. We're all so egocentric after all.**"**

## Georges Moustaki - Les eaux de Mars
Klô Pelgag: **"**Actually, since February, this song has been in my playlist. But also the original version (Elis Regina and Tom Jobim) as well as the English version (Art Garfunkel). So I've been listening to the same song three times in a row, but I haven't got bored of them yet. Is this the point at which we see how strong our link with the artwork can be? I remember when I found out that the original version wasn't by Georges Moustaki. I was a bit disappointed then I feld in love with each of the other versions, a few years apart.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Klô Pelgag – J'aurai les cheveux longs
Marion: **"**Delving into the archives, ‘Return To Jeka’ brings together eight previously unreleased works recorded between 1983 and 1985. Michal's tunes have a hazy fidelity, flitting nimbly between electronics and layers of hand drums.**"**

## Aidan Knight – Sixteen Staires
Marion: **"**The electroacoustic duo of guitarist Kallie Lampel and cellist Steve Goodwin (aka Skeleton Zoo) combine hypnotic guitar loops, electroacoustic sounds and shimmering electronics to create a somewhat hazy, rusty and cinematic sound. Transportive.**"**

## Justice Der – Age of Consent
Marion: **"**A peaceful and almost pastoral homage to Albert Ayler, originally composed by a master from the first generation of the AACM, Leroy Jenkins.**"**

## The Districts – Velour and Velcro
Marion: **"**Anarchist Mountains is a duet project between Jordan Christoff & Stefan Christoff. Devoid of computer sounds, screens or presets, their meditative and ambient palette of sounds uses only synthesizers, organ, various hardware effects and field recordings.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to Michal Turtle for his Sunday selections, and to [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr/) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
