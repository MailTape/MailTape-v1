<p id="introduction">Salut ! comment ça va ? Bien ou bien ? Yes, this morning we're gonna speak in french, or rather speak in english about the revival of French pop. The new waves of bands singing mostly in french. A thing that french pop singers had almost forgotten. It’s not coming from a patriotic phenomenon but from a strong desire to touch our emotions with a language that we understand and feel deeper than any others. I began to dive in this musical revolution when I discovered [Cléa Vincent](https://www.facebook.com/cleavincentmusic/?fref=ts). And now there are plenty of references which I treasure. </p>

# The magic formula

For this new generation, to sing in french wasn’t a choice but a deep desire, almost an evidence. Artists like Clea Vincent write their songs, inspired by the golden age of French pop, the 80’s. Their songs resonate in the hearts of French youth, like a magic formula made possible only when one listens to lyrics in her mother tongue.

Clea Vincent’s songs are falsely naive and full of metaphors. Flippant exquisite poetry. It’s not innocent that she chose a song from “Les Beaux Gosses” (_Flairs - Bus_), this movie is a part of our new cultural pantheon. I think it’s just the beginning. It takes time to unbind our generation and let it consider a new way to make pop in french. I expect a huge tsunami of greats bands who're gonna reshape our pop in french.


# La délicieuse séléction de Clea Vincent
 
## Ricky Hollywood - Parti dans le passé (Athanase Granson edit)
Cléa Vincent : _"Ricky Hollywood and Athanase Granson are two artists of the Parisian indie scene that I love, each have their distinct project. Their songs are allways soft. Ricky got an 80's poetry, Athanase is more inspired by 60's weird psychedelic folk. It's the perfect music for sunday mornings!"_

## Flairs & Riad Sattouf - Bus
C.V.: _"This one is in the original soundtrack of my favorite movie : "Les Beaux Gosses" by Riad Sattouf"_

## Kumi Solo - Ce soir
C.V.: _"I recently wrote a songs for Kumi, I really enjoyed working with her, she's so cute!!! I'm her best fan!“_
