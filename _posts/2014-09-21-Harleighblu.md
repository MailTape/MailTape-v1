<p id="introduction">
This morning, we're back and with a Lady: please welcome [Harleighblu](https://soundcloud.com/harleighblu "Harleighblu Soundcloud'").</p>
 
# Soul Vibes
 
[Harleighblu](https://www.facebook.com/HarleighbluOfficial "Harleighblu Facebook'") was raised with soul and rare grooves in the feeding bottle. That's maybe what explain the fact that she's been very talented from a very young age. Now on Tru Thoughts, the [Diva](http://www.tru-thoughts.co.uk/artists/harleighblu "Harleighblu's Tru Thoughts Page") delights us with her punchy and sometimes more personal songs. Hope you'll enjoy.
 
# Her morning inspiration
 
## Bilal - When will you call
_Harleighblu:_ **"**Because Bilal is one of the greatest vocalists of all time! And his voice is truly inspirational to me, I could listen to him all day every day so he's gotta be number one!**"**
 
## Little Dragon - Sunshine
_Harleighblu:_ **"**I keep listening to this banger! Its got big harmonies, a beautiful soul vocal and is dancey enough to get you right outta bed in the morning! I love this tune.**"**
 
## Jill Scott - Golden
_Harleighblu:_ **"**My fav vocalist in the world !! I picked this tune because it gives you that spring in your step in the morning, to make you feel like you can take on the world!**"**
