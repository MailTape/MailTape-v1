This morning, blablabla blabla blabla 
</p>

# Saycet's morning inspiration
<br>

## Nojat Thing ft. Kazu Makino - Eclipse/Blue
_Saycet:_ **"**Kazu's voice on a Nojat Thing track, it's wonderful. Not much more to say. I've listened to this song a lot on mornings, sunday or not.**"**
 
## Julie Losfelt - One Against a Million

 
## José Gonzalez - Crosses
_Saycet:_ **"**Actually, I could have list nearly every song by José Gonzalez. There is a serenity in his music that move me deeply.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to our guest [Saycet](https://www.facebook.com/saycet?fref=ts "Saycet's Facebook") for his selection, to Stephane and to Philippe Lévy for the picture. 
Enjoy your Sunday !
