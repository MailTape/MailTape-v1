<p id="introduction">This morning, we bring you a decidedly eclectic episode. It attempts to bring out some of the best sounds together from different genres. Featuring a swedish indie folk singer, Jose Gonzalez along with a LA based electronic musician, Nosaj Thing, this episode comes off as a take on music that will never cease to wow you.</p>

#Entering a new journey
Saycet is a project undertaken by a Parisian artist, Pierre Lefeuvre. Saycet's music encompasses sounds that are elusive, introspective and experimental. One might even slide into a time warp while journeying through his atmospheric tracks. 

# Saycet's morning inspiration

## Nosaj Thing ft. Kazu Makino - Eclipse/Blue
_Saycet:_ **"**Kazu's voice on a Nojat Thing track, it's wonderful. Not much more to say. I've listened to this song a lot on mornings, sunday or not.**"**
 
## Julie Losfelt - One Against a Million

 
## José Gonzalez - Crosses
_Saycet:_ **"**Actually, I could have listed nearly every song by José Gonzalez. There is a serenity in his music that moves me deeply.**"**
