<p id="introduction">This morning, kickstart your day with Hector Gachan’s warm and lively selection. Hector Gachan, who grew up between Australia and Bosnia, makes catchy lo-fi dream pop songs, influenced by his upbringing in between these two countries. He released his [debut album](https://lnk.to/hectorgachan_untitled91) two days ago.</p>
<p>Let this selection take you out of your lethargy, help you fight the coldness of winter, be the soundtrack of what you want your morning to be. Get cosy or get busy, your call.</p> 



# Hector Gachan's selection

## Yuko Yuko – Two Boys
_Hector Gachan_: **"**This a track and a half right here folks. Pure psychedelic pop with a cheeky 80's feel to it. Catchy as hell. Wonderful female lead vocals with some call and response like chorus backed up by Yuko Yuko's Elias. So Mashallah!**"**

## Jermango Dreaming - I Want You
_Hector Gachan_: **"**Smooth as butter. Jermango serves us 'I Want You' a tune of pure love, longing and reassurance. No matter the distance or situation... He and I still want you.. Good enough to eat, good enough to dunk in your coffee. Clean sound all round, swinging beat, mid 20th century pop finesse, keys and a solo good enough to get your granny rockin'. Mashallah!**"**

## Jerry Paper - Everything is Shitty
_Hector Gachan_: **"**As soon as this randomly popped up on my lappy.. I knew this was exactly where I wanted to be musically that sunday mornin'.. Lyrically the track is pretty insane. Extremely dark and yet so serene musically. Warm organs, multi layered vocals singing along with gorgeous high pitched female sampled vocals. The song is a dystopian sonic venture. Perfect way to start the end of your week. To quote a random youtube comment on this track "It's like if vaporwave was actually music." Mashallah...**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Hector Gachan - Untitled '91
_Inès_: **"**I can't remember how I discovered Hector Gachan but I know it's with [Normal](https://soundcloud.com/hectorgachan/hector-gachan-normal), a ghostly track with a great guitar line. I've been meaning to feature him on a MailTape episode for a while now, and I'm happy to have him as a guest today. Untitled ’91 is a super catchy tune, and perfect to chill out on Sunday mornings.**"**

## Superorganism - Something for Your M.I.N.D.
_Inès_: **"**The musical equivalent of 100 litres of multi-vitamin juice.**"**

## Sean Nicholas Savage - Opposing Truths
_Inès_: **"**I won’t lie, one of the reasons I chose this song is because of the shared lyrics with Hector Gachan’s second selected track. Other than that, it’s also because it’s a nice, kinda cheesy, delicate ballad with an amazing chorus.**"**

## Maison de Retraite - today i am a piece of shit 
_Inès_: **"**Hector Gachan picked a song about everything being shitty, so I picked a song about being a piece of shit. To be fair, this track is just noisy nonsense, which for some reason makes a lot of sense to me. Happy Sunday guys, let’s all bask in the satisfying feeling of knowing that we can be useless human beings today.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks!
