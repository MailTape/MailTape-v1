<p id="introduction">This morning, discover [Cliché](https://www.facebook.com/cliche.pop?_rdr), The first band to have signed with Microqulima: a new French-pop label. How immortalize and modernize the best of French Pop tradition ? Sing in french first, add the famous false innocent instru behind, a little bit electronic but don't forget acoustics instruments. And here we are, The quintessence of 21th century's French Pop ! </p>

# Cliché, the new frenchpop scene.

Cliché’s first EP consists of 5 tracks that warmly slide into your ears. You’re hit by a strong wave that elicits feelings of childhood while leaving you awestruck. The lyrics are romantic and metaphoric, like “Helicon”, which transforms the brass instrument into an allegory of freedom. 

# From Bordeaux with love.
 
## Avi Buffalo - Truth Sets In
_Cliché:_ **"**For us,_Truth Sets In_ is one of the most beautiful pop song of 2010, as simple and beautiful as Sunshine.**"**
 
## Cylob - Rewind!
_Cliché:_ **"**We love for a while productions of the label Rephlex, and particulary from Cylob. It's kind of loony, it mix pop and electronic, we love the destruct process on voices.**"**
 
## Daniel Johnston - Speeding Motorcycle
_Cliché:_ **"**We discover Daniel Johnston through Yo La Tengo, a band we love a lot. His maladjustment to the standardized world and his freedom are particulary touching. This track give us a survey to his messy and DIY universe.**"**
