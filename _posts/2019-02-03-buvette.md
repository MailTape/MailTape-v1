<p id="introduction">This morning, we are extremely pleased to welcome [Buvette](https://buvette.bandcamp.com/) and let him start our Sunday. His latest album [Elasticity](https://paneuropeanrecording.bandcamp.com/album/elasticity), recorded in Paris at Point Ephemere Studios and released on 2016, played on repeat as I was driving the roads of the Dead Sea last summer.</p>

Since then, I've been looking forward to releasing an episode with him. This gentle mindbomb starts with a 20minute-ish track to help you relax and let yourself get into a trip of exploration, love, creativity, passion and realization. An ode to creativity, a call to stay awake. What we need is you, truly alive. 

Let's go...

# Buvette's selection

## [Terekke](https://terekke.bandcamp.com/) - NuWav2
_Buvette_: **"**This thing is magic. If you listen to it on Sunday morning you can relive the best moment of the day before, in slow motion. Then you really wake up and it gets more and more intense. You may smile when you read to me, but in my opinion this music is very strong because through the place it leaves to auto-suggestion, you can really transpose what you want into it. Imagine a big kick over it now. Then a hi-hat, a bass line. Hop, it stops and here comes the lyrical singer who joins us. Anything is possible You are free to feel what you want. It's deadly.**"**

## [Losange](https://johnkoolrecords.bandcamp.com/album/quartz) - Spleen Sidéral
_Buvette_: **"**A song that I like very much and that I put in several mixes. Now is the time to get up and open the curtains on a morning full of promises.**"**

## [Vashti Bunyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashti_Bunyan) - Love Song
_Buvette_: **"**The day I have children I will wake them up and fall asleep with Vashti's music.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Buvette - All the Sounds in One
_ImaCrea_: **"**It's been difficult to choose a track given that his album, [Elasticity](https://paneuropeanrecording.bandcamp.com/album/elasticity), is so full of great tracks. 'All the Sounds in One' is a kind of trip summarizing the overall feeling of it, in fact that is its last track. And this voice...**"**

## AMA//MIZU - Waiting Room (Face To Face)
_ImaCrea_: **"**Instant crush. Reminds of the feeling I had when I discovered Nicolas Jaar at his debut. Makes me realize how creativity is important to me, I see any creative act as a deep affirmation of humanity. Any creation is a message of hope, a light to conjure the darkness.**"**

## Sunken - Swoon
_ImaCrea_: **"**Coffee is ready. A warm cup in my hands, I gently blow on it and as I look by the window I see the greyish winter sky of Paris. "Will there be any sunlight today or not?" I ask to myself. I don't know but this track is so warm I'm ready for a new beautiful day.**"**

## Kate Tempest - Pictures on a Screen
_ImaCrea_: **"**This gentle anger I got in my stomach, it's ok. I feel it's important to keep it, to keep staying awake no matter what. Kate Tempest delivers an important message in all of her tracks. I knew I wanted to share here one but it's been hard to choose which, after many hesitation I chose this one for his great balance between gentleness and consciousness. Wake up now, for real. We need you.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening to this episode.
