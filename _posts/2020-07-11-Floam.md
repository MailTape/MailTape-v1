<p id="introduction">This morning, we are pleased to welcome [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) to select three Sunday morning songs with us. 

Based in Brooklyn, New York, Floam is pushing into experimental musical/visual territory. Self proclaimed "bouncy rock" musicians, Floam blends a host of influences into a neat, new sound. 
</p>

# Floam's selection

## Margo Guryan - Sunday Morning
Floam: **"**This one is a little on the nose, but it's a recent favorite. It's a radiant song about love on Sunday morning, and the production is a journey that is a joy each time.**"**

## Devonté Hynes and Mockasin - Feelin' Lovely

Floam: **"**Devonté Hynes (aka Blood Orange) and Connan are two favorites of ours and their collaborative EP from 2015 is a gem. Feelin' Lovely is snappy and scribbly and good for you and the rest of your day!**"** 

## Khruangbin - Evan Finds The Third Room
Floam: **"**Khruangbin's sound is open and organic and playful and raw. Start your morning with affirmations (the repeated "yes!" in the track) for an energetic day.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) – Thinking Back
Sarah: **"**The bossa nova groove in the beginning of this track drew me in first, and then throughout the rest of the song, Floam's guitarist does everything right. The mix on *Thinking Back* makes such an interesting balance of soft rock influences, modern jazz, and experimental production methods. Listen for the break  towards the end of this song, it brings the track to a whole new level. As with all of Floam's discography, Thinking Back is smooth.**"**

## [Schwey](https://lauramarling.bandcamp.com/) – Elasto
Sarah: **"**.**"**

## [Sno Aalegra](https://cassmccombs.bandcamp.com/) – FEELS
Sarah: **"**The retro energy and the vocals make this track such a smooth mix, perfect for getting yourself out of bed in the morning.**"**

## [TOPS](http://jimcroce.com/) – I Feel Alive
Sarah: **"**Keeping up with positive affirmations (YES! of the Khruangbin track), here's another one... do you feel alive on this very fine Sunday morning? Are you going to dance in your bedroom?? Will you have ice cream for breakfast or wear mismatching socks? This song and this episode makes me want to do all of that, I hope you feel the same way :)**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Thank you so much for joining us. Much love to Marc Desse for his  selection, and to [Noemie Dijon](https://noemiedijon.tumblr.com/) for this episode's beautiful illustration.</p>
