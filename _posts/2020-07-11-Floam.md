<p id="introduction">This morning, we are pleased to welcome [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) to select three Sunday morning songs. 

Marc Desse, a French singer and musician, mixes hedonist texts with a laid-back style, creating spontaneously a warm and languid sound. If you listen carefully, you should be able to detect pretty easily some influences from bands like Aline or Taxi Girl.

His last luminous songs promise an energizing and romantic album (coming soon). An album that we imagine as a declaration of love for the city, with a new track titled "Paris je t'aime" to be released in the next few days.

# Floam's selection

## Margo Guryan - Sunday Morning
Floam: **"**This one is a little on the nose, but it's a recent favorite. It's a radiant song about love on Sunday morning, and the production is a journey that is a joy each time.**"**

## Devonté Hynes and Mockasin - Feelin' Lovely

Floam: **"**Devonté Hynes (aka Blood Orange) and Connan are two favorites of ours and their collaborative EP from 2015 is a gem. Feelin' Lovely is snappy and scribbly and good for you and the rest of your day!**"** 

## Khruangbin - Evan Finds The Third Room
Floam: **"**Khruangbin's sound is open and organic and playful and raw. Start your morning with affirmations (the repeated "yes!" in the track) for an energetic day.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Marc Desse](https://www.instagram.com/marc.desse/) – On s'aime
Sarah: **"**To start summer properly, I recommend that you listen to this song that can increase the atmosphere of any street by 5 degrees with a big cocktail and a large fan in front of you. Like a big warm hug blurring the sunny lanes.**"**

## [Jim Croce](http://jimcroce.com/) – Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels)
Sarah: **"**Jim Croce's lyricism captures the turbulence of our emotions, and what it feels like to let go of trespasses others have caused us, even if that release is anti-climactic. I stumbled upon this song going through Jim Croce's album, _You Don't Mess Around With Jim_. As you listen, you'll find it's a one-sided conversation with an operator, where the narrator asks for his ex-lover's number, before ultimately realizing the attempt at contact is unproductive, choosing not to make any call at all. Weeks ago, I wanted to egg my ex-boyfriend's house. I got the eggs, a getaway car, and I was all set to go. I believed that in egging his house, he would understand that I'd been hurt by him during the relationship. I craved his recognition, with the idea that it would help my own healing. This phenomenon of wanting to be seen and heard by those that hurt us is puzzling, and it's one that Jim Croce explores here. Ultimately, the narrator tells the operator to forget the call, because, "there's no one there I really wanted to talk to." Instead of following through with my plan, I put the eggs back in my fridge. Even though our impulses may seem valid enough to act on, in the end of the day, not everyone deserves your vulnerability."**"**

## [Laura Marling](https://lauramarling.bandcamp.com/) – Song For Our Daughter
Sarah: **"**Listening to Laura Marling over the years has been like listening to her own life evolution. Starting as a small indie voice playing the ukulele, she has never stopped growing. Her latest album is like a climax, but always delicate and subtle.**"**

## [Cass McCombs & Steve Gunn](https://cassmccombs.bandcamp.com/) – Sweet Lucy
Sarah: **"**What is better than a naive and catchy melody to complete your waking up in the morning and start brewing your coffee? It's up to you.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Thank you so much for joining us. Much love to Marc Desse for his  selection, and to [Noemie Dijon](https://noemiedijon.tumblr.com/) for this episode's beautiful illustration.</p>
