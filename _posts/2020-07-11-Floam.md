<p id="introduction">This morning, we are pleased to welcome [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) to select three Sunday morning songs with us. 

Based in Brooklyn, New Yorkk, Floam is pushing into experimental musical/visual territory. Self proclaimed "bouncy rock" musicians, Floam blends a host of influences into a neat, new sound. 

His last luminous songs promise an energizing and romantic album (coming soon). An album that we imagine as a declaration of love for the city, with a new track titled "Paris je t'aime" to be released in the next few days.

# Floam's selection

## Margo Guryan - Sunday Morning
Floam: **"**This one is a little on the nose, but it's a recent favorite. It's a radiant song about love on Sunday morning, and the production is a journey that is a joy each time.**"**

## Devonté Hynes and Mockasin - Feelin' Lovely

Floam: **"**Devonté Hynes (aka Blood Orange) and Connan are two favorites of ours and their collaborative EP from 2015 is a gem. Feelin' Lovely is snappy and scribbly and good for you and the rest of your day!**"** 

## Khruangbin - Evan Finds The Third Room
Floam: **"**Khruangbin's sound is open and organic and playful and raw. Start your morning with affirmations (the repeated "yes!" in the track) for an energetic day.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) – Thinking Back
Sarah: **"**The bossa nova groove in the beginning of this track drew me in first, Floam's guitarist is doing everything right. The mix on **Thinking Back** makes such an interesting balance of soft rock influences, modern jazz, and experimental production methods. Listen for the break away towards the end of this song, it brings the track to a whole new level. As with all of Floam's discography, **Thinking Back** is _smooth_.**"**

## [Eluvium](https://lauramarling.bandcamp.com/) – Dusk Tempi
Sarah: **"**This song was commissioned by the National Geographic and was made with ultrasonic echolations of an endangered subspecies of bat in Indiana. 
The music was made possible by bats, but it also sounds like two aliens falling in love. The song starts with the two extraterrestrials seeing each other across a music festival (yes, they have those on their planet, which for privacy purposes, we cannot disclose the name of). Zeelp is dancing, her many arms swinging in the air, and Norf is infatuated instantly. Norf later gets the courage to go talk to Zeelp, and is swept off his seven feet by her long green eyelashes and purple ankles. Norf is especially charmed by Zeelp's four orange head antennae. As the song progresses, so do their lives, they marry and raise an alien child together (three heads on their firstborn, how lucky!). Though Zeelp and Norf get older, they remain very much in love. They sit on their porch, looking at their perfectly manicured fuchsia lawn and their many-headed grandchildren running all about. They talk about when Norf first saw Zeelp at that music festival and how happy they are to have met each other.**"**

## [Jim Croce](http://jimcroce.com/) – Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels)
Sarah: **"**"**"**

## [Dorothy Ashby](https://cassmccombs.bandcamp.com/) – Soul Vibrations
Sarah: **"**Absolutely love the harp on this track. The groove driving the song is so unique, it's easy to see why so many groups have sampled Dorothy Ashby's sound. **"**
