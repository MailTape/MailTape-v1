# Parra for Cuva's morning inspiration

## Balmorhea - Bowsprit
_Parra:_ **"**I’m following this band for nearly 8 years now and every album is just wonderful. Their Albums “River Arms” and “Constellation” are some of my all time favs. In this song I especially love the simpleness and ruff beginning which has such a strong development. It always gives me goosebumps.**"**
 
## Mark Ronson's - A la Modeliste (Bonobo remix)
_Parra:_ **"**No Sunday without this one. This is my definition of a good vibe track. The first time I heard it I was in New Zealand and we played it in the car over and over again.**"**
 
## Tom Day & Monsoonsiren - Elegiac
_Parra:_ **"**Tom Day is such a strong composer with a very special feeling for details and harmonics. If you like this song you should also check out his track "Flamington".**"**
 
<p id="outroduction">
That’s all folks! 9 more playlists and we'll hit the 200th one. This could not have happened with you, and without the amazing team who joined me in this beautiful adventure. Beauty is everywhere, and we're here to stay and keep reminding it to you every Sunday morning. With much Love.
