# The greatness of nature invigorate his music

David Douglas is an Utrecht based electronica producer. He released his debut EP “Royal Horticultural Society” in 2012 and started 2014 with a brand new single, entitled “Higher”. Higher is the first track of his new full-length album due to release 22th of May this year. You can pre-order it on [bandcamp](http://atomnation.bandcamp.com/album/moon-observations "Pre-order now!").

# His morning selection

## Franz Schubert - Piano Trio In E Flat
David Douglas: **"**My father was a graphic designer and played a lot of classical music while he was working. Probably that’s why I still have a huge love for those great composers. Classical music is a big inspiration, it used to be as popular as pop music nowadays is.**"**

## Midlake - Act of Man
David Douglas: **"**Some time ago I made a road trip through France with my brother. This song was popping up over and over. Beautiful soundtrack for road trips on summer nights.**"**

## Air - Le Voyage de Penelope
David Douglas: **"**When I was 18 I discovered Air. That summer I was hanging with friends along the river side. With beers, the sun and Moon Safari on high rotation.**"**
