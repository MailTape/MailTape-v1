<p id="introduction">
This morning, please welcome to a delighted guest ! Half Colombian, Half French, but born in Brooklyn, Gabriel Garzon-Montano is a true child of the world. </p>

# French + Colombian + Brooklyn
That's the cocktail for his classy vibes. Where silents are as important as the melody, where the groove is cold and his voice warm as South-America. Let's listen an impressive selection where his amazing talent is reflected by his tripolars inspirations.

# His selection for a classy morning

## Quincy Vidal - Check
_Gabriel:_ **"**I love this woman with my heart and soul. Listen up. Tough and delicate. This is my shit!**"**

## Sage Caswell - Whatever Forever
_Gabriel:_ **"**Dark funky house vibes on this one. Sage Caswell and Archie Pelago man... goldmines.**"**

## How Bout Now - Drake
_Gabriel:_ **"**Love the sample (although I had never heard the original not gonna front) and the nostalgic feeling of that diminished chord moving up to the minor. That move gets me every time. Lyrics are perfect. Love me a song about underdog days haha. Motivational and soulful music.**"**
