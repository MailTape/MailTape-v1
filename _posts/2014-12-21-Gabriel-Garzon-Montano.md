<p id="introduction">
This morning, you'll wake up with some Californian vibes thanks to our guest [B.Lewis](https://soundcloud.com/blewie17 "B.Lewis Soundcloud")</p>

# French + Colombian + Brooklyn

Back to 2010, B.Lewis caught our attention up with his EP [La Semaine](http://blewis.bandcamp.com/album/la-semaine "B.Lewis - La Semaine on Bandcamp"), 'week' in english: 7 days, 7 tracks with a perfect flow. Four years later and some very cool others [EPs](http://blewis.bandcamp.com/ "B.Lewis Bandcamp") after, we're very happy to let you discover the selection of this San Jose California based producer.
Hope you'll enjoy...

# His selection for a classy morning

## Quincy Vidal - Check
_Gabriel:_ **"**I love this woman with my heart and soul. Listen up. Tough and delicate. This is my shit!.**"**

## Sage Caswell - Whatever Forever
_Gabriel:_ **"**Dark funky house vibes on this one. Sage Caswell and Archie Pelago man... goldmines.**"**

## How Bout Now - Drake
_Gabriel:_ **"**Love the sample (although I had never heard the original not gonna front) and the nostalgic feeling of that diminished chord moving up to the minor. That move gets me every time. Lyrics are perfect. Love me a song about underdog days haha. Motivational and soulful music.**"**
