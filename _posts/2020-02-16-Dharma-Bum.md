  This morning, it is madness that takes us, that puts us in a trance, that
  makes us do anything, but that allows us to take things as they come and to
  see life differently. It is this same madness that we find again this Sunday

<p id="introduction">This morning, it is madness that takes us, that puts us in a trance, that makes us do anything, but that allows us to take things as they come and to see life differently. It is this same madness that we find again this Sunday with the group Dharma Bum, a measured, beautiful and energetic madness!
<br><br>
The music of [Dharma Bum](https://dharmabumbum.bandcamp.com/album/deux), as strange as their name may sound, is punctuated with madness and psychedelic exoticism taking us to faraway lands. This quintet from Rouen released their EP "DEUX", last November, an incredible vitamin digest.

# Dharma Bum's selection

##  [Biche](https://www.facebook.com/bichemusic) - L’Essor  
_Dharma Bum_: **"**This is ma lazy Sunday song. You only have to listen to the lyrics to understand why. « Passer du temps à rien faire, mais bien le faire ». This sentence means a lot to me. It sounds super peaceful.**"**

##  [Barbagallo](http://www.barbagallo.fr/) - On se décide 
_Dharma Bum_: **"**From Amor de Lonh, the first Barbagallo’s LP. This is a fantastic sunday mood album but focus on a broken relationship. Whatever, this is still sweet, like a perfect sunny sunday afternoon. I really enjoy this acoustic Beatles sound with the Julien’s charming voice.**"**

##  [Grauzone](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grauzone) - Eisbär 
_Dharma Bum_: **"**This is my winter track. Actually i didn’t knew who the band was few years ago when i rediscovered that song, but it just immediately spokes to me when i heard it, the mix between guitar/synth noise and 80’s new wave beat is very catchy. Short songs always make you crave for more.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Dharma Bum](https://soundcloud.com/dharma-bum1)  - Worship The Ease
_Anaïs G_: **"**Resonant guitars, waves of change and different sounds in the same track totally captivated and transported me. With an almost hypnotic and incredibly psychedelic ending.**"**

## [Freak Heat Waves](https://freakheatwaves.bandcamp.com/album/beyond-xxxl) - Self Vortex
_Anaïs G_: **"**Between post-punk, kautrock and synth-pop there's only one step... And that's precisely where his Montrealers appear out of nowhere, offering us a song from their album "Beyond XXXL" as absurd in its musicality and yet so innovative and offbeat in its originality. Geniuse! **"**

## [François Virot](https://soundcloud.com/francoisvirot) - Legal Rough 
_Anaïs G_: **"**It is on the b-side of the vinyl "[AC39 Split 7](https://soundcloud.com/atelierciseaux/sets/ac39-francois-virot-phern-1)" released on the label [Atelier Ciseaux](https://soundcloud.com/atelierciseaux), that I discovered François Virot. Something subtle, melodically pop and very DIY.**"**

## [Judah Warsky](https://soundcloud.com/judahwarsky) - Je M'en Souviendrai Jusqu'à La Fin de Ma Life (Remix Sarah Maison)
_Anaïs G_: **"**I hadn't yet listened to the track that the title had already seduced me. This was confirmed as soon as Judah Warsky started singing... So with the remix of [Sarah Maison](https://sarahmaison.bandcamp.com/) that I love, it is even more sublime.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to [Dharma Bum](https://soundcloud.com/dharma-bum1) for his Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/) for her brilliant illustration.</p>
