# Dharma Bum's selection

##  Biche - L’Essor  
_Dharma Bum_: **"**This is ma lazy Sunday song. You only have to listen to the lyrics to understand why. « Passer du temps à rien faire, mais bien le faire ». This sentence means a lot to me. It sounds super peaceful.**"**

##  Barbagallo - On se décide 
_Dharma Bum_: **"**From Amor de Lonh, the first Barbagallo’s LP. This is a fantastic sunday mood album but focus on a broken relationship. Whatever, this is still sweet, like a perfect sunny sunday afternoon. I really enjoy this acoustic Beatles sound with the Julien’s charming voice.**"**

##  Grauzone - Eisbär 
_Dharma Bum_: **"**This is my winter track. Actually i didn’t knew who the band was few years ago when i rediscovered that song, but it just immediately spokes to me when i heard it, the mix between guitar/synth noise and 80’s new wave beat is very catchy. Short songs always make you crave for more.**"**
