# 2nd Exit's selection

##  [wnbl](https://wanubale.bandcamp.com/album/who-is-she-feat-ev-n) feat. [Mike Nasa](https://mikenasa.bandcamp.com/) - Still Not In Space
2nd Exit: **"**Had this track on repeat when we first heard it. It’s a beautiful hip hop/jazz hybrid - top shelf rhyming from Berlin-based Mike Nasa over a rhythmically and harmonically rich bed of live instruments from German collective wnbl. The Hargrove-esque horns top it off nicely. This one will remain in regular rotation for a loooong time.**"**

## [Oakstop Alliance](https://oakstopalliance.bandcamp.com/album/royalty-summit), [Homeboy Sandman](https://homeboysandman.bandcamp.com/),[A-Plus](https://aplus.bandcamp.com/), [Michael Sneed](https://michaelsneed.bandcamp.com/track/blame-sumer-ft-molly-arizona), [Dakim](https://ddustdirect.bandcamp.com/) - Look at the Rim
2nd Exit: **"**We’re both big Homeboy Sandman fans…everything he does is...well, he just doesn’t seem to miss. This track is no exception. It’s from a compilation album with Oakland-based nonprofit Oakstop Alliance showcasing Oakland’s homegrown hip hop talent. The track (produced by Dakim) is weird enough to catch the ear, but still has that boom bap thing we love, and all the rhymers on there match feet with Homeboy Sandman so there are no wet spots.**"**

##  [Imaginary Friend](https://blaqnumbers.bandcamp.com/track/a2-imaginary-friend-all-cats-are-beautiful-prod-by-donnie-moustaki), [Donnie Moustaki](https://donniemoustaki.bandcamp.com/album/gtva-3) - All Cats Are Beautiful
2nd Exit:**"**This one’s from a homie, Imaginary Friend (from London by way of Berlin), one of our favourite rappers and one of the most formidable writers we know. Love the double entendre in the title/its acronym. he rhymes about his love for cats (or perhaps his dislike for something else) over a juicy beat from elusive multi-instrumentalist/producer Donnie Moustaki (these two have dropped a few tracks together - all gold and worth checking out). We have a joint EP dropping with Imaginary Friend this year…keep an ear out…!.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [2nd Exit](https://2ndexit.bandcamp.com/album/2nd-exit) - Understand
Sarah: **"**Last track on 2nd Exit's most recent album, [Tangent](https://2ndexit.bandcamp.com/album/tangent). Love the subtlety of these jazz backings, esp. the bassline. The spoken chorus surprises, only slightly slanting into song and yet effortlessly in rhythm with the key section surrounding it. Lester Duval and Alfa Mist pass sections back and forth between each other with such flow, the track is seamless.**"**

## [Isatta Sheriff](https://isattasheriff.bandcamp.com/album/isatta-sheriff-2) & [Koralle](https://koralle.bandcamp.com/) - Will They Try
Sarah: **"**Isatta Sheriff regards this track as the most important off of her recent album, Eat The Kiwi Skin, in that it seeks to address exploitation of Black women in hip hop. Reflecting on this in the album's writeup, addressing the principle implementation gap as she writes, 'People often ask the same questions regarding women’s position in hip hop, and I ask _will they try to understand_ the full scope of the problem and then DO something, because the conversation is stuck and needs to progress.'**"**

## [Theo Croker](https://theocroker.com/), [Ego Ella May](https://egoellamay.bandcamp.com/), [D'LEAU](https://dleau.bandcamp.com/album/01) - GOOD DAY
Sarah: **"****"**
