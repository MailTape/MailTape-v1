<p id="introduction"> This morning, you need to rest, to let yourself go to other sensations, or to rediscover simple pleasures such as enjoying your loved ones, the rays of the sun, bird watching or even feeling the wind in your neck. The band [Sierra Manhattan](https://soundcloud.com/sierra-manhattan) accompanies us in this playlist of quiet and let live.
<br><br>
The band Sierra Manhattan, released their new EP "[Which Life, The Friends](https://abrecords.bandcamp.com/album/which-life-the-friends)" on [AB Records](https://abrecords.bandcamp.com/), on February 17th. With the return of the sun and long naps on the deckchair, it's good news to get carried away by the offbeat pop.

# 2nd Exit's selection

##  [wnbl](https://soundcloud.com/jsdonny) feat. Mike Nasa - Still Not In Space
2nd Exit: **"**Had this track on repeat when we first heard it. It’s a beautiful hip hop/jazz hybrid - top shelf rhyming from Berlin-based Mike Nasa over a rhythmically and harmonically rich bed of live instruments from German collective wnbl. The Hargrove-esque horns top it off nicely. This one will remain in regular rotation for a loooong time.**"**

## [Oakstop Alliance](https://soundcloud.com/agcook), Homeboy Sandman, A-Plus, Michael Sneed, Dakim - Look at the Rim
2nd Exit: **"**We’re both big Homeboy Sandman fans…everything he does is...well, he just doesn’t seem to miss. This track is no exception. It’s from a compilation album with Oakland-based nonprofit Oakstop Alliance showcasing Oakland’s homegrown hip hop talent. The track (produced by Dakim) is weird enough to catch the ear, but still has that boom bap thing we love, and all the rhymers on there match feet with Homeboy Sandman so there are no wet spots.**"**

##  [Imaginary Friend](https://soundcloud.com/kraftwerkofficial), Donnie Moustaki - All Cats Are Beautiful
2nd Exit:**"**This one’s from a homie, Imaginary Friend (from London by way of Berlin), one of our favourite rappers and one of the most formidable writers we know. Love the double entendre in the title/its acronym. he rhymes about his love for cats (or perhaps his dislike for something else) over a juicy beat from elusive multi-instrumentalist/producer Donnie Moustaki (these two have dropped a few tracks together - all gold and worth checking out). We have a joint EP dropping with Imaginary Friend this year…keep an ear out…!.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## 2nd Exit - Understand
Sarah: **"**I liked their quirky, funny pop. This non-conceit that we should live every day, and it is with this song that I can imagine a crazy chorus made in improv in the kitchen demon apartment while preparing food. Completely letting go, this album ["Which Life, The Friends"](https://abrecords.bandcamp.com/album/which-life-the-friends) on the [AB Records](https://abrecords.bandcamp.com/) label, released last February 17th, is a breath of freshness!**"**

## [Miryam Solomon](https://soundcloud.com/miryamsolomon) - Romance
Sarah: **"**The sound captivated me at first and [the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gWwpveW3sQ) did the rest. I was carried away by this magic of lapping, of a rather Japanese style that makes us become as light as the feeling of being on a cloud.**"**

## [Cleo Sol](https://soundcloud.com/cleosol) - Spirit
Sarah: **"**Just as beautiful and quiet as Miyram Solomon, the singer Cleo Sol whom I had discovered thanks to her song "[Why Dont'You](https://soundcloud.com/cleosol/cleo-sol-why-dont-you)". This time I came across her album released in September 2021 entitled "[Mother](https://soundcloud.com/cleosol/sets/mother)" which talks about her new life as a young mom. A jewel, neo-soul, soothing, full of optimism and soft as a cocoon sweater.**"**

## [Nilüfer Yanya](https://soundcloud.com/niluferyanya) - Midnight Sun
Sarah: **"**To close this playlist, nothing better than a song that wakes us up and makes us happy for the rest of the day. I discovered Nilüfer Yanya with her main tracks like "[Angels](https://soundcloud.com/niluferyanya/04-angels)" or "In Your Head", from her album "[Miss Universe](https://soundcloud.com/niluferyanya/sets/miss-universe)". Since then, I've only followed this talented British singer who released her new opus "[Painless](https://soundcloud.com/niluferyanya/sets/painless)". Even though there are still a lot of amazing songs on this album, my favorite is "Midnight Sun". Once again we find the same ingredients, a low voice, a crazy style and saturated guitars, everything I love!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning's selection! Thank you for joining us, we hope you danced :) Our love to [Sierra Manhattan](https://abrecords.bandcamp.com/album/which-life-the-friends) for these wonderful Sunday selections, and many many thanks to Meriam Kharbat for this episode's fantastic illustration!
