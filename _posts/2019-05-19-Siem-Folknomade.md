<p id="introduction">This morning we are pleased to welcome a long time MailTape listener and Marseille-based vocalist and composer, [Siêm Folknomade](https://linktr.ee/siemfolknomade).
<br><br>

In her own words, her music is 'the celebration of a nomadic folk imbued with sweet metaphors, dissolutely original and eternally ephemeral'. If you're in Marseille on 24th May, she'll be performing at [La Mesón](https://www.facebook.com/events/349829132291153/).</p>


# Siêm Folknomade's selection

## Ry x – Bound
_Siêm Folknomade_: **"**Hypnotic and melancholic. A vaporous spirit that melts me deep in the heart. Love the emergency heartbeat and the silence! Love the minimalist beauty of this artist. [Ry x](https://www.ry-x.com/) has all the spirit of ubiquity and universality. That's the 'Nowhere Everywhere' songs I love. So nomadic!**"**

## [Maii Waleed](http://maiiwaleed.daportfolio.com/) – يوم الاتني
_Siêm Folknomade_: **"**Meaning 'Monday' in Arabic. So ambitious for a Sunday morning mood! haha. Love the rêverie of the track. I am fan of this artist and her neo-alternative musical vision. So mellow like a creamy milky kawa!**"**

## [Nonku Phiri](https://soundcloud.com/nonkuphiri) – Sîfo
_Siêm Folknomade_: **"**This ode to grief is a recent neo-electro & soulful discovery. I feel this song like a rewarding to shadow. A peaceful inner celebration. Love the life whatsoever and beyond any intuition.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Siêm Folknomade – Et Même Si
_Sanjay_: **"**[Siêm Folknomade](https://linktr.ee/siemfolknomade) has been a listener of MailTape for many years. When she emailed me about appearing as a guest in her own right while offering her debut EP 'BlackSheepColorist', I thought it would be pleasure to welcome her melancholy music and lyrics of exile...**"**

## Emiliana Torrini – Tookah
_Sanjay_: **"**There's something of the pastoral electronica here; rooted in atmospheric folksy melodies upon bubbling percussive beats. 'Tookah' is a word made up, apparently, by [Emiliana Torrini](https://emilianatorrini.com/) to describe 'a sense of inner peace and tranquillity that can be present in everyone'.**"**

## Lilith Ai – Native Tongue
_Sanjay_: **"**[Lilith Ai](https://soundcloud.com/lilithai) is an accomplished singer-songwriter drawing subtly on folk, soul, hip-hop and R&B. All of this is seen through the barrier-trashing lens of punk spirit, which explains her 'Fight Like A Girl' crew.  It involves zinework, recording and enthusiastic intimate gigs in makeshift locations, allied to a sense that rigid genre (and rigid gender) boundaries are less important than constructive intent and political engagement.**"**

## The Last Poets – If We Only Knew What We Could Do 
_Sanjay_: **"**A scan through hip-hop’s genealogy shows the genre’s flair for dexterous word play is partly rooted in the work of [The Last Poets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Poets), alongside Gil Scott-Heron. Smooth and cogent, the group—consisting of Seventies-era members [Abiodun Oyewole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiodun_Oyewole) and [Umar Bin Hassan](http://umarbinhassan.com/), along with percussionist Baba Donn Babatunde and other collaborators, including avant-jazz bassist [Jamaaladeen Tacuma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaaladeen_Tacuma)—is back with a follow-up. 'Transcending Toxic Times' addresses themes it has been tackling since its founding in Harlem in 1968, including racism, oppression and the sins of America’s past.**"**



<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always thank you so much for joining us! Much love and respect to [Siêm Folknomade](https://linktr.ee/siemfolknomade) for her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for her stunning illustration.</p>
