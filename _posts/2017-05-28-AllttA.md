<p id="introduction">This morning, let's all recline back and savor the novelty of a decade for having influenced a number of today's great artists. With lyrics that are pervasive and reminiscent of the past, [AlltA](https://www.facebook.com/allttamusic/), consisting of the duo 20syl, a french producer and LA based rapper, Mr. J. Medeiros, is all set to rekindle our love for the old-school 80’s hip-hop.</p>

# AllttA's selection

## Oddisee - Like Really
_20syl_: **"**He released his new album a few weeks ago and it's a banger, as usual. One of the most complete artists that I know of, and I also think of him as tje best MC/producer nowadays. I love his prods, his flow, his voice. This track is a perfect blend of a modern production and organic soul/gospel arrangements.**"**

## Emmet Fenn - Painting Greys
_20syl_: **"**It's Jay (Mr.J.Medeiros, half of AllttA) who sent me this track, first so I could listen to the voice treatment, which is quite original. The emotions are beautiful and the instrumental part is really powerful. It a great track to edit or to play in a set.**"**

## Noisia - The Entrangled (Camo & Krooked Remix)
_20syl_: **"**I previously knew Noisia for more abrupt productions, here I think it’s more subtle. The track never explodes and that is what’s interesting, it build up during the whole track without a drop and explosion at one point.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## AllttA - Paradise Lost
_Louise_: **"**It's so great to meet 20syl and Mr. J. Meideros in a mutual music project. High expectations and high results. Their album, The Upper Hand, is a must listen!**"**

## Barrio Lindo - Circunvalar
_Louise_: **"**I just discovered Barrio Lindo and loved it immediately. According to him, his music is a meeting point between traditional folk music of South America and electronic, which is the “new way” to make music nowadays. I really like the blend of it, particularly in the album, _Albura_.**"**

## Os Tincoãs - Deixa A Gira Girar (j g b edit) 
_Louise_: **"**Since I listen to J G B edit all the time, it couldn't sit in my personnal playlist any longer. This track makes me want to dance real bad and it's also really smooth, I love it.**"**

## Kiefer - Kickinit Alone
_Louise_: **"**As Oddisee was opening this tape, I had to choose another amazing producer to close it. Meet Kiefer, a californian producer and pianist whose work is a match between jazz and alternative hip-hop. You may already have listened to him in [MNDSGN](https://www.mailta.pe/255/mndsgn/)'s MailTape! The piano of this track is just a pure treat.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [AllttA](https://www.facebook.com/allttamusic/) for the selection, to Sidd for his words and to [Anais Caura](http://cargocollective.com/anaiscaura) for her wonderful illustration.</p>
