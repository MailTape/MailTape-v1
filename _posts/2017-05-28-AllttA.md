# AllttA's selection

## Oddisee - Like Really
_20syl_: **"**He released his new album a few weeks ago and it's a banger, as usual. One of the most complete artist that I know of, and — to me — one of the best MC/producer nowadays. I love his prods, his flow, his voice. This track is a perfect blend of a modern production and more organic soul/gospel arrangements.**"**

## Emmet Fenn - Painting Greys
_20syl_: **"**It's Jay (Mr.J.Medeiros, half of AllttA) who sent me this track, first so I could listen to the voices treatment which is quite original. A very beautiful emotion and the instrumental part is really powerful. It a great track to edit or to play in a set.**"**

## Noisia - The Entrangled (Camo & Krooked Remix)
_20syl_: **"**I knew Noisia for more abrupt productions, here I think there's more subtlety and retain. The track never explodes and that is what's interesting, it build up during the whole track without a drop and explosion at one point.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## AllttA - Drugs
_Louise_: **"**In this song, Mr. J. Meideros express how he feels about drugs, and it's quite interesting to have a point of view like his in the music industry.**"**

## Barrio Lindo - Circunvalar
_Louise_: **"**I just discovered Barrio Lindo and love it immediatly. As he says, his music is a meeting point between traditional and folk music of South America and electronic music, which is the "new way" to make music nowadays. I really like the blend of it all in his album _Albura_.**"**

## Os Tincoãs - Deixa A Gira Girar (j g b edit) 
_Louise_: **"**I listen to this J G B edit on replay for a week or so. It couldn't sit in my personnal playlist any longer. This track make me want to dance so bad and it's also really smooth, I love it.**"**

## Kiefer - Kickinit Alone
_Louise_: **"**As Oddisee was opening this tape, I had to choose another amazing producer to close it. Meet Kiefer, a californian producer and pianist who's work is a match between jazz and alternative hip-hop. You might already have heared him in [MNDSGN](https://www.mailta.pe/255/mndsgn/)'s MailTape! The piano of this track is just a pure treat.**"**
