# AllttA's selection

## Oddisee - Like Really
_20syl_: **"**He released his new album a few weeks ago and it's a banger, as usual. One of the most complete artist that I know of, and — to me — one of the best MC/producer nowadays. I love his prods, his flow, his voice. This track is a perfect blend of a modern production and more organic soul/gospel arrangements.**"**

## Emmet Fenn - Painting Greys
_20syl_: **"**It's Jay (Mr.J.Medeiros, half of AllttA) who sent me this track, first so I could listen to the voices treatment which is quite original. A very beautiful emotion and the instrumental part is really powerful. It a great track to edit or to play in a set.**"**

## Noisia - The Entrangled (Camo & Krooked Remix)
_20syl_: **"**I knew Noisia for more abrupt productions, here I think there's more subtlety and retain. The track never explodes and that is what's interesting, it build up during the whole track without a drop and explosion at one point.**"**
