# Melenas's selection

## Yo La Tengo - Autumn Sweater

Melenas: **"**Oh... this Autumn feeling! One of our favorites to listen to at home or in the van, this song feels like coming back home after a rainy day. Undoubtedly inspiring for us, it is beautifully constructed, with the steady drums and the subtle percussion, along with the powerful and melancholic vintage organ and the soothing and sensitive Ira Kaplan's vocals... it feels like a warm blanket wrapped around you.**"**


## Magnetic Fields - You and Me and the Moon

Melenas: **"**One of those songs that immediately gives you a shot of energy and good vibes! An euphoric boost that describes perfectly a crush. We really can't avoid start dancing (even in the van) and singing along these beautiful vocals, which make a perfect harmony combo (in the original song, just to make it clear :))**"**

## Aventuras de Kirlian - Victor

Melenas: **"**Víctor is a very special song for us, with its absolutely pop melody and its exotic beat drawn by slide and bass in a loop that absorbs you right from the start.
It makes you feel like being in a dream, and like in dreams, now you're here and then you're there... Maybe on a roof waiting for the rain, or maybe in your room, surrounded by lizards that lie to you with their hypnotic humming...**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Martin Dupont - Inside Out

Sarah: **"**From the very first second, the energy of this sound gripped me and didn't let go for weeks. I only discovered Martin Dupont recently and, without having experienced the original era of these intoxicating rhythms, I still feel a sweet and joyful sense of nostalgia. It was a time when music was magically crafted with electronic instruments to convey the full emotional power of human life at its strongest. An ode to youth, love, and life.**"**

## Gary Allen - Oops It's an Accident

Sarah: **"**As I listened for days to compilations of new wave and albums picked up along with the groove of the moment, suddenly comes this completely crazy sound. Taken directly and instinctively in my gut, this track by Gary Allen is a kind of magical encounter between queer madness and the grandiloquence of minimal synths. Grace Jones in a convertible speeding through a neon tunnel.**"**

## El - Og Tilslutt

Sarah: **"**After listening to so much new wave, I fell into a romantic trip. Of course. And for me, this sound encapsulates all the poetic romance so unique to the genre. You can feel the inspiration of The Cure in the bass, obviously, but here with an even darker atmosphere. Dracula transformed into a wolf howls in the heart of the forest. Where has the imagination gone?**"**


## Art Fact - Rain in the South

Sarah: **"**End of the 80s in Sweden, a cold, industrial, polluted world stands as an insurmountable horizon. The machine has taken over, money is king. Smoke pours out of factories. Contemporary sadness, where has the future gone? Have we woken up from this nightmare or have we convinced ourselves that it was only a dream in our torpor maintained by screens that absorb all our attention? It is good to cry, to experience this sadness. To better transmute it, to live all our emotions, to accept them and then overcome them. And finally find our desire again.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s all for this Sunday morning! Thanks for being with us. Much love to [Melenas](https://martindupont.bandcamp.com) for their wonderful selection and to Noémie for this fantastic illu. See you next Sunday morning !</p>
