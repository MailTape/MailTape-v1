<p id="introduction">This morning, stay cosy with [CMON](https://www.facebook.com/confusingmixofnations/)’s intimate selection. CMON, short for Confusing Mix of Nations, is made up of Josh da Costa and Jamen Whitelock (who were part of [Regal Degal](https://regaldegal.bandcamp.com/)). Making catchy pop music with lots of different influences, they have released their [first EP](https://soundcloud.com/confusingmixofnations/sets/cmon-ep) a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>In today’s episode, the colour is burgundy, the matter, velvet. Find the most comfortable spot in your house. Take it slow this morning, meditate, light candles, create a plush atmosphere just for the sake of it. Rebel against this winter that seems to be never-ending. Let [CMON](https://www.facebook.com/confusingmixofnations/)’s selection make you feel all warm inside.</p>



# CMON's selection


## Richard Horowitz - Eros Never Stops Dreaming
_CMON_: **"**A standout track from a truly intriguing and heady album recently reissued by my friends at Freedom To Spend, though I was lucky enough to pick up an original copy at a local record store right before the dam burst, so to speak.**"**

## Pete Brandt's Method - What You Are
_CMON_: **"**A gentle drift through some kind of romantic oblivion. Possible hangover helper. Another lucky score thanks to my man Sidney at Redlight Records, which has since been compiled on a fantastic compilation via Music From Memory.**"**

## Actuel - Day's End
_CMON_: **"**Feels appropriate for a Sunday that might be spent lamenting the inevitable end of the day and the beginning of another crazy week... Much love and gratitude to Jackson Pollis + Daniel da Costa for sharing their knowledge, and to Stephen D. Anderson for writing and recording this one. I recommend exploring more of Stephen's recordings that he has personally uploaded to Soundcloud. A treasure trove!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## CMON - Coo
_Inès_: **"**CMON’s [first EP](https://soundcloud.com/confusingmixofnations/sets/cmon-ep) is a mix of vibrant and catchy tracks, ranging from disco-influenced to kinda epic to dreamy ones ([Dreamfucking](https://soundcloud.com/confusingmixofnations/dreamfucking) is my favourite one on there). ‘Coo’ is by far the sexiest track out of them: bewitching synths, slow guitar riffs, jerky drum machines, sensual singing and a very cool break in the middle.**"**

## Mildlife – The Magnificent Moon
_Inès_: **"**Mystical, groovy… magnificent. Lose yourself for 9 spacey, psychedelic, jazzy minutes and travel to other dimensions.**"**

## Morabeza Tobacco - TTYL
_Inès_: **"**My love for mellow lo-fi melancholic dream-pop songs that you can daydream on is infinite, so there we go again. ‘TTYL’ is a hazy tune feeling like long warm summer nights, afternoons chilling in parks and the quiet joy of peacefully doing nothing.**"**

## Jerry Paper – International Man of Melancholy
_Inès_: **"**I used to hate Sundays, but now they’re my little island of comfort in somewhat dull weeks. However, I never turn down an occasion to whine, so, to mirror CMON’s last pick, here is mine: Jerry Paper’s International Man of Melancholy. Lament both pure and ironic, perfectly balanced in the shape of a song for days when you feel like shit but feel foolish about being like this.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for listening and to [CMON](https://www.facebook.com/confusingmixofnations/) for being our guest today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
