<p id="introduction">This Sunday morning is all about revived retro grooves:) [JWestern](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases) hits MailTape with a dynamite neo-soul selection to get us moving. 
  
  Two days ago, JWestern released his debut EP, [Just People](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases). Full of velvet vocals, jazz riffs, and spiraling pockets of layered instrumentals, the EP moves through the many modes of relationships and the space they take up in our heads. Based in Leeds, JWestern is influenced by an array of jazz and neo-soul musicians, clearly evident by the stretches of jazz riffs and grooves in his own songs:)

# JW Francis's selection

## [Ash Soul, Inc.](https://rejjiesnow.bandcamp.com/) - I Do Love You
JW Francis: **"**The whole POINT of music is to communicate feelings that can't be expressed in words. The two biggest areas we have trouble verbalizing are 'hurt' and 'love,' and they're so often intermingled. This track is a smooth Sunday morning gem that says a lot more than "I do love you. I really really do love you" in a beautiful way. I can't recommend it enough. 10/10.**"**

## [Ruru](https://raveenamusic.bandcamp.com/) - I Forgot
JW Francis: **"**I don't know much about Ruru except that she is from the Philippines and she makes music that I'm obsessed with. I've been living with this song in particular for a while now. Sometimes you have to make a tradeoff between interesting chords and a strong melody, but this song has both PLUS a backbeat that immediately draws you in. 10/10.**"** 

## [Kaitlyn Aurelias Smith](https://oscarjerome.bandcamp.com/) - Stratus
JW Francis: **"**I was first introduced to this song while I was horizontal on the ground looking up at the sky. My friend Mark Brathwaite said 'hold on a minute' and put this on. How to describe this track? I feel like I am decomposing. I feel like I am the waves washing up on a shore, but also the sand that is being molded by the waves (which is also me). Groundless and grounding. 10/10.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [JWestern](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases) – Let's Disappear
Sarah: **"**JWestern's entire [new EP](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/album/just-people-ep) made it tough to choose just one track, but I kept coming back to this one. Its slowed down groove highlights JWestern's layering, gradually enough to be appreciated properly. Smooth and soft vocals backed up with the jazz bassline and guitar riffs feel like an embrace, an entire atmosphere of instrumental ebbs and flows. This track felt the most natural to write for JWestern, and the most authentic to his experience. His EP may be entitled [Just People](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/album/just-people-ep), but JWestern's honesty with relating the many swells of relationships make the experiences feel more profound than just that.**"**

## [Jenny Penkin](https://jennypenkin.bandcamp.com/) – Born Last Night
Sarah: **"**Feel the movement in this one :)! Jenny Penkin takes on a journey of sound, brushing funk, jazz, and neo-soul. The sliding synths and the funk bassline deliver psychedelic dream energy. Aerial vocals shrouding the percussives make the song feel ethereal.**"**

## [Lady Wray](https://ladywray.bandcamp.com/) – Storms
Sarah: **"**Lady Wray's previous discography (**Get Ready**, [Piece of Me](https://ladywray.bandcamp.com/album/piece-of-me-b-w-come-on-in)) solidified a signature 1970's swaying soul influence. Last week's release keeps with her retro inspirations but this track transcends into something godly. The plunging piano bass laced with Lady Wray's voice and the celestial chorus combine into an almost religious energy. So smooth and so powerful.**"**

## [Ex-Olympian](https://exolympian.bandcamp.com/) – Taste of Love (San Giorio di Susa)
Sarah: **"**Ex-Olympian's new album, [Afterlife](https://exolympian.bandcamp.com/album/afterlife), is a medley of soul and jazz influences given new meaning in their modern context. The album as a whole serves as a playground for combining contemporary sampling and soul roots. The brass section in this song with the bassline engineer a vintage feel, one that Ex-Olympian plays around with for the track. 
Listen for the xylophone at the end :)**"**
