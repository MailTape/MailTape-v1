<p id="introduction">This Sunday morning is all about revived retro grooves:) [JWestern](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases) hits MailTape with a dynamite neo-soul selection to get us moving. 
  
  Two days ago, JWestern released his debut EP, [Just People](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases). Full of velvet vocals, jazz riffs, and spiraling pockets of layered instrumentals, the EP moves through the many modes of relationships and the space they take up in our heads. Based in Leeds, JWestern is influenced by an array of jazz and neo-soul musicians, clearly evident by the stretches of jazz riffs and grooves in his own songs:)

# JW Francis's selection

## [Ash Soul, Inc.](http://www.numerogroup.com/d/ash-soul-inc-i-do-love-you) - I Do Love You
JW Francis: **"**The whole POINT of music is to communicate feelings that can't be expressed in words. The two biggest areas we have trouble verbalizing are 'hurt' and 'love,' and they're so often intermingled. This track is a smooth Sunday morning gem that says a lot more than "I do love you. I really really do love you" in a beautiful way. I can't recommend it enough. 10/10.**"**

## [Ruru](https://rutheday.bandcamp.com/) - I Forgot
JW Francis: **"**I don't know much about Ruru except that she is from the Philippines and she makes music that I'm obsessed with. I've been living with this song in particular for a while now. Sometimes you have to make a tradeoff between interesting chords and a strong melody, but this song has both PLUS a backbeat that immediately draws you in. 10/10.**"** 

## [Kaitlyn Aurelias Smith](https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/) - Stratus
JW Francis: **"**I was first introduced to this song while I was horizontal on the ground looking up at the sky. My friend Mark Brathwaite said 'hold on a minute' and put this on. How to describe this track? I feel like I am decomposing. I feel like I am the waves washing up on a shore, but also the sand that is being molded by the waves (which is also me). Groundless and grounding. 10/10.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [JW Francis](https://jwfrancis.bandcamp.com/album/we-share-a-similar-joy) – I'm Down, Whatever
Sarah: **"**Listening over the new album, We Share A Similar Joy, I was struck by the overwhelmingly genuine presence JW Francis has in his songwriting. The deeply nostalgic confrontations with himself are beautifully intertwined with the music JW Francis wraps them around. Talking to JW about this track made me more fascinated with it, especially as he expressed that in this track, he felt the most free.**"**

## [Elan Noon](https://jennypenkin.bandcamp.com/) – Modern Blues
Sarah: **"**This track comes from Elan Noon's fantastic new album, Colour Story. Chord and melody dissonance comes into play throughout the album in such an engaging ensemble of sound. The calculated dissonace in this track, like many of the album's others, is carefully and gracefully threaded with Keenan Mittag-Degala's velvet vocals. The balance of guitar dissonance, gentle synths, and hazy vocals bring out such sweet and spiraling harmonies.**"**

## [Lady Wray](https://ladywray.bandcamp.com/) – Storms
Sarah: **"** **"**

## [lyam.](https://exolympian.bandcamp.com/) – Pretty Pretty
Sarah: **"**Songs like this gift us the wonderful opportunity to forget ourselves. Ourselves and the ticking and the trembling of our lives, the heaviness nested on our shoulders, even our acceptance of such realities. With these bubbling basslines, mellow guitar strums, and soft falling vocals, we slip away from all of it. For a moment, we leave these areas of pressure and stark reality for greener pastures of romantic thinking, where every tedious feature of our lives might be poetry instead. Listen to these instrumentals and sink into the flowers of your mind (that, luckily, have been there the entire time).**"**
