<p id="introduction">This Sunday morning is all about revived retro grooves:) [JWestern](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases) hits MailTape with a dynamite neo-soul selection to get us moving. 
  
  Two days ago, JWestern released his debut EP, [Just People](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases). Full of velvet vocals, jazz riffs, and spiraling pockets of layered instrumentals, the EP moves through the many modes of relationships and the space they take up in our heads. Based in Leeds, JWestern is influenced by an array of jazz and neo-soul musicians, clearly evident by the stretches of jazz riffs and grooves in his own songs:)

# JW Francis's selection

## [Ash Soul, Inc.](https://rejjiesnow.bandcamp.com/) - I Do Love You
JW Francis: **"**The whole POINT of music is to communicate feelings that can't be expressed in words. The two biggest areas we have trouble verbalizing are 'hurt' and 'love,' and they're so often intermingled. This track is a smooth Sunday morning gem that says a lot more than "I do love you. I really really do love you" in a beautiful way. I can't recommend it enough. 10/10.**"**

## [Ruru](https://raveenamusic.bandcamp.com/) - I Forgot
JW Francis: **"**I don't know much about Ruru except that she is from the Philippines and she makes music that I'm obsessed with. I've been living with this song in particular for a while now. Sometimes you have to make a tradeoff between interesting chords and a strong melody, but this song has both PLUS a backbeat that immediately draws you in. 10/10.**"** 

## [Kaitlyn Aurelias Smith](https://oscarjerome.bandcamp.com/) - Stratus
JW Francis: **"**I was first introduced to this song while I was horizontal on the ground looking up at the sky. My friend Mark Brathwaite said 'hold on a minute' and put this on. How to describe this track? I feel like I am decomposing. I feel like I am the waves washing up on a shore, but also the sand that is being molded by the waves (which is also me). Groundless and grounding. 10/10.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [JWestern](https://jwesternn.bandcamp.com/releases) – Let's Disappear
Sarah: **"**Listening over the new album, We Share A Similar Joy, I was struck by the overwhelmingly genuine presence JW Francis has in his songwriting. There's this beautiful intertwining of deeply nostalgic confrontations with himself and the music he uses to express this, which I found comforting in its optimism.**"**

## [Jenny Penkin](https://jennypenkin.bandcamp.com/) – Born Last Night
Sarah: **"**Trying to find pockets of peace everyday:) Yesterday, I took a bite out of a very nice peach and it was enough. When appreciated properly, little moments of levity can carry smiles , and sometimes, this is fantastic to remember, especially when listening to good music like this :) I hope the -- and the break toward the end bring you as much joy as they brought me. **"**

## [Lady Wray](https://ladywray.bandcamp.com/) – Storms
Sarah: **"** **"**

## [Ex-Olympian](https://exolympian.bandcamp.com/) – Taste of Love (San Giorio di Susa)
Sarah: **"**Songs like this gift us the wonderful opportunity to forget ourselves. Ourselves and the ticking and the trembling of our lives, the heaviness nested on our shoulders, even our acceptance of such realities. We slip away from all of it. For a moment, we leave these areas of pressure and stark reality for greener pastures of romantic thinking, where every tedious feature of our lives might be poetry instead. Listen to these instrumentals and sink into the flowers of your mind (that, luckily, have been there the entire time).**"**
