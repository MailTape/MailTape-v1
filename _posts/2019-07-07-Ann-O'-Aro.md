# Ann O'Aro's selection



## Dakh Daughters  -  Rozy Donbass
Ann O'Aro: **"**The first time I listened to this band, I had a few projects about musik, dance and theater with friends, mostly women plugged on "sorority".If I had hooked to this concept, obviously this track will be his very illustration : mix of fighting energy, spoken words, an evocation of resilience and beauty, a way to become yourself. I absolutly love repeating patterns, the rage of the bow and these cries, true explosion of expressive being.**"**

## Björk - All is full of love
Ann O'Aro: **"**This song testifies to the period of my life when I could feel absolutely miserable and invincible at once with an absolute creed: you attract what you dread.I was 15 years old and I was singing that in my head when my father hit me for the last time. I felt that he was afraid of me and that the roles were finally reversed. This is the beginning of both combat and inner peace.**"**

## Sainkho Namtchylak - Violet River
Ann O'Aro: **"**Listening to that song, her voice has both dried the water from my mouth and filled my eyes. There are landscapes in there. As if she scanned the surrounding reliefs, establishing an accurate map of the world, touching the oral territories of Aboriginal peoples. From its tongues that say steppes and tundras, desert or ocean, specifying the shape of a common rock. As an augmented or fragmented reality. A trip in her company is a bit like some discussions, an update of the filter by which I see the world.**"**
