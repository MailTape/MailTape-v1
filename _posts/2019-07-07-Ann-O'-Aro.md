description: This morning, we take a one-way trip to La Réunion. Beaches as far as the eye
  can see, mountainous landscapes almost volcanic, kitchen smells that would
  make you want to eat a typical dish when you wake up ... This is often the
  image this island gives! It is through my half Creole boyfriend and especially
  through artists like Ann O Aro that we have another facet of this intense
  island.

<p id="introduction">This morning, we take a one-way trip to La Réunion. Beaches as far as the eye can see, mountainous landscapes almost volcanic, kitchen smells that would make you want to eat a typical dish when you wake up ... This is often the image this island gives! It is through my half Creole boyfriend and especially through artists like [Ann O'Aro](https://annoaro.bandcamp.com/) that we have another facet of this intense island.
  
<br><br>
The history of our heritage, of our ancestors, of our wounds and of our experience [Ann O'Aro](https://www.facebook.com/Ann-Oaro-1406292983013326/) transcribes it with such force in these words that we cannot stand still in the face of this music with deep roots. As the Reunions would say "Fé Lév lo mort", which means "to give back to the taste of the day the things of the past". That’s how Ann O'Aro tells us her story in Reunion Creole in the guise of maloya.

# Ann O'Aro's selection


## [Dakh Daughters](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakh_Daughters)  -  Rozy Donbass
Ann O'Aro: **"**The first time I listened to this band, I had a few projects about musik, dance and theater with friends, mostly women plugged on "sorority".If I had hooked to this concept, obviously this track will be his very illustration : mix of fighting energy, spoken words, an evocation of resilience and beauty, a way to become yourself. I absolutly love repeating patterns, the rage of the bow and these cries, true explosion of expressive being.**"**

## [Björk](https://www.bjork.fr/) - All is full of love
Ann O'Aro: **"**This song testifies to the period of my life when I could feel absolutely miserable and invincible at once with an absolute creed: you attract what you dread.I was 15 years old and I was singing that in my head when my father hit me for the last time. I felt that he was afraid of me and that the roles were finally reversed. This is the beginning of both combat and inner peace.**"**

## [Sainkho Namtchylak](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainkho_Namtchylak) - Violet River
Ann O'Aro: **"**Listening to that song, her voice has both dried the water from my mouth and filled my eyes. There are landscapes in there. As if she scanned the surrounding reliefs, establishing an accurate map of the world, touching the oral territories of Aboriginal peoples. From its tongues that say steppes and tundras, desert or ocean, specifying the shape of a common rock. As an augmented or fragmented reality. A trip in her company is a bit like some discussions, an update of the filter by which I see the world.**"**


# MailTape's selection


## [Ann O'Aro](https://annoaro.bandcamp.com/album/ann-oaro) - Zwazo
Anaïs G: **"**Ann O'Aro’s music touched my heart. Like an open letter, or therapy to heal her ailments, she pierces me with her life force and poetry.**"**

## [Rosemary Standley](https://www.facebook.com/standleyrosemary/) & [Dom La Nena](https://www.facebook.com/DomLaNena/) - Sega Jacquot
Anaïs G: **"**Sweet and small dance step for this revival of [Luc Donat](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Donat) gave with the singer of [Moriarty](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriarty_(groupe)) and Dom la Nena, native of Brazil. A minimalist version of a popular song from La Réunion.**"**

## [Saodaj'](https://www.facebook.com/saodaj/) - Somin Lamour
Anaïs G: **"**The new Reunion scene has so much to offer us, and Saodaj understood that. Maloya, this music so strong, so liberating, so universal, the band uses Reunion traditional percussions to extend their talent to its audience.**"**

## [Maya Kamaty](https://www.facebook.com/MayaKamaty/) - Diampar
Anaïs G: **"**A song that propels you from your bed to let you go into a frenetic maloya dance. Maya Kamaty offers us through her music something mixed, sometimes pop and trip hop, she mixes her Reunion roots with poetry, a delight for the ears.**"**



<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always thank you so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Ann O'Aro](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_O%27aro) for her Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration. </p>
