<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Atlanta-based music producer [Fit of Body](https://fitofbody.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape.
<br><br>
Born and raised in College Park, Georgia, Ryan Parks has become an important player in the local electronica and hip hop scene. He founded and runs his own robust cassette tape label, [Harsh Riddims](https://harshriddims.bandcamp.com/), has been releasing his own music as Fit of Body for 7 years and still finds the time to paint his album covers. His soulful house ballads are taking us to his favorite places for skating all across Atlanta and beyond, where all his inspirations, from Detroit techno scene to southern rap groups, ride together.

# Fit of Body's selection

## C. Memi + Neo Matisse - Dream's Dream
_Fit of Body_: **"**I heard this track on a compilation called Nihon No Wave. It really stood out to me, made my ears perk up. She has a 12" titled "Heavenly Peace" that's really good as well.**"**

## [Love Letters](https://lovelettersmusic.bandcamp.com/releases) - Co-Locate
_Fit of Body_: **"**My friend Maxime Robillard, aka Love Letters, is about to release his new album, "A Given World of Good Energy" (released October 12th). This is his favorite track off the tape.**"**

## Randy Weston - Congolese Children
_Fit of Body_: **"**Unfortunately, I was not familiar with Randy Weston before he passed. The first record of his that I checked out was "African Cookbook", and this track is off of that record.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Fit of Body](https://fitofbody.bandcamp.com/) – Black Box, No Cops
_Jules_: **"**Fit of Body released his last LP "Black Box No Cops" in June 2018. Black Box, or Black Blocks is a place on the corner of Baker and Piedmont in downtown Atlanta where he used to spend a lot of time skating. It's a cop free zone, so relax and let Ryan take you on board with this opening song.**"**

## Tony Allen & Jeff Mills - The Seed
_Jules_: **"**This is what happens when you throw two legendary musicians from different worlds into the studio. **"**

## [Leon Vynehall](https://leonvynehall.bandcamp.com/) - Movements (Chapter III)
_Jules_: **"**"Nothing Is Still", Leon Vynehall's debut album, is dedicated to his grandparents who emigrated from a leafy south east U.K. to New York City in the 1960s. It flows between splendor and mutedness to describe the journey for assimilation in a new country. To me this song conjures up the image of his grandparents carrying their high hopes amongst roaring cars and still homely skyscrapers...**"**

## [Tirzah](https://tirzah.bandcamp.com/) - Devotion (feat. Coby Sey)
_Jules_: **"**I  heard about Tirzah two months ago with her debut album "Devotion" and, since then, I have been listening to it on repeat. I wanted to close this episode with a vibrant song and I have to admit that the combination of her soulful voice and the melancolic piano melody has a truly hypnotic effect on me.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Fit of Body](https://fitofbody.bandcamp.com/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
