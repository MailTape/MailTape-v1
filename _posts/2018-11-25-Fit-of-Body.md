<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Atlanta-based music producer [Fit of Body](https://fitofbody.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape.
<br><br>
Sara has been crafting composed and improvised music for over 10 years, utilising her classically-trained voice on her compositions. Her approach touches on various musical threads, but it is not necessarily tethered to any—refracting, bending, suspending, and shifting sounds and syllables, creating a kind of linguistic limbo.</p>


# Fit of Body's selection

## C. Memi + Neo Matisse - Dream's Dream
_Fit of Body_: **"**I heard this track on a compilation called Nihon No Wave. It really stood out to me, made my ears perk up. She has a 12" titled Heavenly Peace that's really good as well.**"**

## [Love Letters](https://lovelettersmusic.bandcamp.com/releases) - Co-Locate
_Fit of Body_: **"**My friend Maxime Robillard, aka Love Letters, is about to release his new album, A Given World of Good Energy (released October 12th). This is his favorite track off the tape.**"**

## Randy Weston - Congolese Children
_Fit of Body_: **"**Unfortunately, I was not familiar with Randy Weston before he passed. The first record of his that I checked out was African Cookbook, and this track is off of that record.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Fit of Body](https://fitofbody.bandcamp.com/) – Black Box, No Cops
_Jules_: **"** **"**

## Tony Allen & Jeff Mills - The Seed

## Leon Vynehall - Movements (Chapter III)
_Jules_: **"** **"**

## [Tirzah](https://tirzah.bandcamp.com/) - Devotion (feat. Coby Sey)
_Jules_: **"** **"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Fit of Body](https://fitofbody.bandcamp.com/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
