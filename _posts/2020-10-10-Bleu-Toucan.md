<p id="introduction">This morning, we fly away, we take to the open sea, to faraway places where the heat reigns supreme. We're not alone to accompany us on this journey, it's in good company with the [Bleu Toucan](https://soundcloud.com/bleutoucan) group that we're going to have a good time.
<br><br>
[Bleu Toucan](https://www.facebook.com/bleutoucan/), here is not a species of bird living in South America (although it does exist) but a music band. This Parisian duo composed of Léo and Manu unveils a French pop music where emotions are king and joy spreads in profusion.

# Bleu Toucan's selection

## Sébastien Tellier – Love
Bleu Toucan: **"**A sweet instrumental music, just to make your mind feel good. Wake him up with no rush, with love and kindness. It extend that cocoon feeling you have when you are in your bed under the blanket, and brings a positive wave.**"**

## Totaly Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs – Don’t You Forget About Me
Bleu Toucan: **"**Another wonderful and very sweet song. TEED has a very sweet and detached voice that is extremely pleasant. A kind of nonchalance that goes very well with the morning. Then the switch song at the end of the track make it become a more groovy track that helps you finish emerging and makes you want to live something nice even on Sundays.**"**

## Benny Sings – Sunny Afternoon
Bleu Toucan: **"**Because it looks like a ray of sunlight passing over a flight of swallows and then through the half-closed blinds to come and lick a bowl of latte on the kitchen table.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Bleu Toucan – Le Hublot
Anaïs G: **"**Discovered 5 years ago with their "Salade de Fruits" EP and my favorite "L'Ananas", since this musical encounter I have never stopped following this band. Their new release, "Universalis," takes us on an instant space trip. My favourite is "The Porthole", perfect for an escape.**"**

## Café Lanai – Lanai
Anaïs G: **"**This title is a caress, a dream, something subtle, sweet. A musical meditation, allowing us to cut with the world around us and plunge into an indescribable trance!**"**

## Paradis – Hémisphère
Anaïs G: **"**In 2014, I started listening to the Parisian band composed of Simon Mény and Pierre Rousseau, with their EP "Couleurs Primaires". Their song "Keep it to yourself" was a musical favorite. So I got interested in this duo by listening to their old EPs, and that's how I came across "Hémisphère". French pop, mixed with house and deep house that sticks well to this Sunday morning playlist.**"**

## Février – La montagne
Anaïs G: **"**It was while listening to the artists from the Profil de Face label, that Février appeared in my listening suggestions. For the arrival of rainy and cold days, the music of February is perfect to warm hearts.**"**
