<p id="introduction"> Do you feel that this Sunday, winter is approaching so strongly that we must now wear an extra layer of clothes? We do too. To avoid sinking into the gray, we invited [MPL [Ma Pauvre Lucette]](https://www.mplofficiel.fr/) to add a more harmonious, more colorful layer, softer to the ears than the sound of wood breaking due to the cold, warmer than the anonymity of swaddled faces.
  <br><br>
  Then, we must know how to let the music speak for itself and step aside, to contemplate. Atypical voices, slow constructions, all the luxuriousness of a world which, as winter allows it, seems to take a break to regenerate and mutate for the better.

# MPL ’s selection

## [Clara Ysé](https://soundcloud.com/clarayse) - Le monde s'est dédoublé
MPL: **"**We discovered this one randomly because our flatmate was recording chorus at this time for a track in his room. We started to listen it then. It’s pretty awkward for the first listening but once you get to listen it more, you’re trapped.**"**

## [Philémon Cimon](https://philemoncimon.bandcamp.com) - Je veux de la lumière
MPL: **"**When we are travelling for gigs, the van is often the perfect place to be completely nostalgic. In that case, we don’t listen to Nostalgie – a French radio – but regularly, Andreas asks to put this song. So on, we adopted it, and loved it.**"** 

## [Thousand](https://thousand1000.bandcamp.com) - Jeune femme à l'ibis
MPL: **"**Because every person have his favorite band, [Cédric] doesn’t break the rule. And this band does that. And if you don’t like it, you’ve missed a thing in your life.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [MPL](https://www.mplofficiel.fr) - Wagon-Wagon
Arthur: **"**From the first notes and this fabulous chorus, it's a journey beginning. And then this song becomes your partner of a moment that leaves you like a accompanied child in transit in an airport, lost and ready to reach out to anyone. On Sundays, when it seems that you have in front of you both too much time, and at the same time not enough before the sun sets again, it is this kind of love story that takes you on board and declare “may the day not be the one you will regret not having spent.**"**

## [Arthur H](https://www.arthur-h.net) - Paris la Silencieuse
Arthur: **"**Used to taking trains, used to continuing the journey of the TGV that arrived at Paris Gare de Lyon with music to slip into the arms of a tumultuous city. The perfect sequel to Wagon Wagon is played with Arthur H. A guru at the same level than MPL’s Arthur.**"**

## [Mildlife](https://mildlife.com.au) - How Long Does It Take
Arthur: **"**This is a big allegory of a post-MPL listening, but without the lyrics. Go through such different layers, from a sweet melancholy towards a desire to clap foots and head that sets in without you realizing it to end with an inexorable desire to run in the street with your mouth open, catching flies and not regret it.**"**

## [MPL](https://www.mplofficiel.fr) - M-A espace M-I-E
Arthur: **"**End with all the beauty of MPL, of the words, of the flow which has the leisure to put vocoder in while the prior talent does not require the slightest pinch. Once the song is over, everything will indeed go M-I-E /better/ during the day.**"**

<p id="outroduction">Beauty has to stop, sorry! Hope you’ve enjoyed it, as to see this day as new, bright and shiny one. Thank you to MPL [Ma Pauvre Lucette] for this selection full of sensibility and yet, a perfect mirror of Sundays as protected into some chaotic outer world. Thank you to [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr) for his great and colored interpretation from a neon-sourced picture of [Xavier Lours](http://xavierlours.fr).

  Listen to silence before it burns out.</p>
