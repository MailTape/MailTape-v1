description: "This morning, enjoy the musical universe of a charming modern crooner. All this exotics percussions mixed with his crooner voice, sound to me as a fresh summer cocktail."
---

<p id="introduction">This morning, step into the musical universe of a crooner called, Trevor Dickson. His debut album "Passion Fruit", was launched last year in November. His swooning lyrical ballads, when expressed in his crooning voice, give you a sense of journeying around the world. Whereas, the sounds produced by his percussions show off the best flavors of summer like a fresh exotic cocktail.</p>
 
# This charming character

Watching the wonderful video of the song, ["Powers"](https://vimeo.com/112319346) without taking an immediate liking to it is simply inevitable. A song about a naive east coast dandy, who tries to approach a wonderful blonde. The kind of character who can speak for hours about traditional pacific chorals and futuristic musical instruments of the 50s. With that said, we hope to hear more from him and that he continues to sway us with his distinctive crooning voice. 
 
# His sweet sunday morning's selection

## Pete Drake and his talking steel guitar - Forever
_Trevor:_ **"**Nothing sets a magical mood like the album "Pete Drake and His Singing Steel Guitar". For decades Pete was a famous session musician with his masterful pedal steel guitar playing, and even produced records, but on this album he breathed new and eerie life into popular hits of the 1960's by playing his pedal steel guitar through a talk box. It sounds like a novelty act, but the record stands out in my collection as one of the most strange and original from that time in pop music.**"**
 
## Billie Holiday - Gloomy sunday
_Trevor:_ **"**Not much needs to be said here. It's Billie Holiday. Few other recorded voices have managed to hypnotize me the way hers has. I just close my eyes and get completely lost in it.**"**
 
## Novicat de Soeurs Missionaires - Yesu Ka Mkwebaze
_Trevor:_ **"**I first heard this track on a Mississippi Records compilation. I love how the gentle percussion, which has a sort of slow and steady heartbeat rhythm driving the composition, carries the beautiful vocal melodies floating over it. This song has a hymn-ish quality to it, and spiritual folk music like this has a special place on my record player come Sundays.**"**
