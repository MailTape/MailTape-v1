<p id="introduction">This morning,
<br><br>
.</p>

 

# Moodoïd's selection


## Le Colisée - Tigre
_Moodoïd_: **"**David invented Le Colisée. David is wonderful. He is one of my favourite musicians. I was lucky that he accepted to write lyrics for me. You can hear his words in the songs ‘Helena’ or ‘Kasbah’.**"**

## Larraji - All of a Sudden
_Moodoïd_: **"**Florian is Garçon d’Argent. I found this demo on his SoundCloud. It is not really the season as it is quite a Christmas-y song, but I think it represents it well. He is the most sincere person I met in the music industry. I feel like we can really realise this here.**"**

## Yves Tumor - Limerence
_Moodoïd_: **"**Nelson Beer is starting to release songs under his own name. His body danses and his music grooves. I am sure we will hear a lot about him in the coming months.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Moodoïd - Reptile
_Inès_: **"**XXX**"**

## Temporex - Sweet Sundae
_Inès_: **"**XXX**"**

## Anemone - Bout de toi
