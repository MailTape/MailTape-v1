<p id="introduction">This morning,
<br><br>
.</p>

 

# Moodoïd's selection


## Le Colisée - Tigre
_Moodoïd_: **"**David invented Le Colisée. David is wonderful. He is one of my favourite musicians. I was lucky that he accepted to write lyrics for me. You can hear his words in the songs ‘Helena’ or ‘Kasbah’.**"**

## Garçon d'Argent - Toi et Moi (démo)
_Moodoïd_: **"**Florian is Garçon d’Argent. I found this demo on his SoundCloud. It is not really the season as it is quite a Christmas-y song, but I think it represents it well. He is the most sincere person I met in the music industry. I feel like we can really realise this here.**"**

## Nelson Beer - I Am A Woman
_Moodoïd_: **"**Nelson Beer is starting to release songs under his own name. His body danses and his music grooves. I am sure we will hear a lot about him in the coming months.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Moodoïd - Reptile
_Inès_: **"**XXX**"**

## Xenoula - Caramello
_Inès_: **"**A captivating and languid song sung with a high-pitched voice, a bit twisted, both delicate and strong.**"**

## Dena - Things That Mean A Lot (w Eyedress & Rhxanders)
_Inès_: **"**XXX**"**

## Anemone - Bout de toi
_Inès_: **"**Time to wake up. I’ve never been one for uber cheesy songs, but this one is an exception. Almost sounding like a child’s song, it is so innocent and pure, yet so groovy and made for dancing (the bridge!). A super enthusiastic song for a super energetic morning!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning, hope you find in this episode the energy to overcome your fears and keep sharing your love. As always, thanks for listening and much love and respect to [Moodoïd](https://www.facebook.com/Moodoid) who just released a new album in the galaxy, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for this great illustration!</p>
