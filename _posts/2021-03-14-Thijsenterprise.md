<p id="introduction">For this special occasion, I want to focus on something that really inspires me but I rarely talk about: songs without a traditional form. I’d like to talk about non-conventional song structures across different genres: bossa-nova, jazz & electronic music.
As a beatmaker, saxophonist, and composer myself, it’s an interesting topic. These are musical ideas and possibilities I already like to use but would like to dive into even deeper for future projects.
Time and time again these tunes have served as inspiration on many aspects of my life, and they continue to inspire me. I hope the music will do the same to people reading this.

[Bonnie Banane](https://www.facebook.com/bonniebananemusique), a ufo from the French alternative R&B scene. She unveils her first album “[Sexy Planet](https://bonniebanane.bandcamp.com/album/sexy-planet)”, released on November 13th, to the extent that we could have imagined!

# Thijsenterprise's selection

## [Tom Zé](https://www.facebook.com/TheMonoNeon/) – Toc
Thijsenterprise: **"**People say music has to reflect the current times. To a certain extent, I agree. But in many cases, that means songs represent that specific time only and therefore can sound outdated after a certain period. “Toc” by Tom Zé is the complete opposite: it just feels like it’s always representing the current time(s) and that makes it timeless. Or in other words: a classic.
Besides this, I discover something new every time I play this song. The song leaves so much room for imagination. Each instrument seems to stand on its own, with its own sound and vibe. But the combination of it altogether gives the song a completely different feel. I could focus only on the horns and the notes, but instead I prefer to listen, close my eyes and let the music guide me to new places.**"**

## [Peter Evans](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Bardot) – Chorales
Thijsenterprise: **"**Peter Evans can do it all. From playing a jazz standard to completely going nuts into free jazz-electro mode. Is that a word even? Man, he can do so much... I guess he can play “Body and Soul” and change tires of a car at the same time, all while he is circular breathing.
This song has been on my mind since it came out in 2011. The first part is rough; not only for Sunday mornings. But when you reach the second part you might feel relieved. This repetitive melody asks you something, doesn’t it? What does it ask you? This tune has been challenging me in many aspects. In my playing, composing, and in my life. I hope it challenges you, too.**"**

## [Jameszoo](https://www.facebook.com/Take6Official/) – Fluke
Thijsenterprise: **"**Although my own music can’t be really considered “electronic,” I have a few names on my radar who inspire me immensely. Fellow Dutchie Jameszoo is one of them. His album Fool on Brainfeeder is big time. Talking ‘bout non-conventional song structures and composing!
“Fluke” is a perfect opener for the album. And a perfect opener for an early morning, too. I love how it starts: unorganized, with several elements, that come and go later during the song. Bird sounds, lasers, percussion, and after a while that extremely catchy synth melody. This is enviable good. It makes me want to go straight to the music lab to brew something new!**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Thijsenterprise – Flash
Sarah: **"**I discovered Bonnie Banane, with the song "[L'Appétit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMbMJE0D4Dk)". I was immediately absorbed by his way of singing and his very particular style which makes it impossible to forget him. Then there were also his featuring with Chassol "[Feu au Lac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwKyMtTn30w)" and Myth Syzer & Ichon "[Le Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCV2YZOffJM)". On her debut album "[Sexy Planet](https://bonniebanane.bandcamp.com/album/sexy-planet)", released last November, I discovered a Bonnie Banane on the edge of her skin, angry, joyful but always in her slightly offbeat and provocative style as we like it.**"**

## [Myth Syzer](http://mythsyzer.fr/) – Je suis venu te dire que je m'en vais 
Sarah: **"**Surprising is the word that came to me when I heard this Gainsbourg cover. Of course, the original is unbeatable but Myth Syzer manages to give a boost to this wonderful song with brio, which gives it a new youth.**"**

## [Muddy Monk](https://muddy-monk.bandcamp.com/) – L'aventura
Sarah: **"**It's while listening again to his EP "[Première Ride](https://muddy-monk.bandcamp.com/)" that I discovered this sound. A tasty ballad, full of poetry and lightness. Perfect for the time ahead!**"**

## [Ichon](https://www.facebook.com/yannichonmusic)– Aujourd'hui
Sarah: **"**I love the music and the character very much but when I came across her latest album “Pour de vrai”, released last September, I was just transcended and wordless in the face of so much beauty. A musical nugget full of sincerity, truth and masculine sensitivity that we love so much!!**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [Bonnie Banane](https://bonniebanane.bandcamp.com/releases) for her Sunday selections and to [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr/) for this episode's brilliant illustration!</p>
