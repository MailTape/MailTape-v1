<p id="introduction">Thijsenterprise is the solo project of Dutch saxaphonist, beatmaker, and composer Reinier Thijs, currently based in Barcelona. Immersed in the world of jazz and the likes of Benjamin Herman John Coltrane, Xero Slingsby, and Pharoah Sanders, Reinier also is passionate about music from the likes of The Lounge Lizards, Knxledge, Nate Smith, and Robert Glasper. <br><br>
  It's this range of influence that not only informs the content of Thijsenterprise's music, but also his musical freedom. Pulling inspiration from bossa nova, electronic music, jazz, and hip hop, Reinier does not find himself constrained to any one genre, leaning into tracks of non-conventional form in each of his albums' arenas. <br><br>
  In short, we are delighted to welcome Thijsenterprise to MailTape for a Sunday morning selection of tracks that explore non-traditional structures, each inspirations to Thijsenterprise in his life and projects.

# Thijsenterprise's selection

## [Tom Zé](https://www.facebook.com/TheMonoNeon/) – Toc
Thijsenterprise: **"**People say music has to reflect the current times. To a certain extent, I agree. But in many cases, that means songs represent that specific time only and therefore can sound outdated after a certain period. “Toc” by Tom Zé is the complete opposite: it just feels like it’s always representing the current time(s) and that makes it timeless. Or in other words: a classic.
Besides this, I discover something new every time I play this song. The song leaves so much room for imagination. Each instrument seems to stand on its own, with its own sound and vibe. But the combination of it altogether gives the song a completely different feel. I could focus only on the horns and the notes, but instead I prefer to listen, close my eyes and let the music guide me to new places.**"**

## [Peter Evans](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Bardot) – Chorales
Thijsenterprise: **"**Peter Evans can do it all. From playing a jazz standard to completely going nuts into free jazz-electro mode. Is that a word even? Man, he can do so much... I guess he can play “Body and Soul” and change tires of a car at the same time, all while he is circular breathing.
This song has been on my mind since it came out in 2011. The first part is rough; not only for Sunday mornings. But when you reach the second part you might feel relieved. This repetitive melody asks you something, doesn’t it? What does it ask you? This tune has been challenging me in many aspects. In my playing, composing, and in my life. I hope it challenges you, too.**"**

## [Jameszoo](https://www.facebook.com/Take6Official/) – Flake
Thijsenterprise: **"**Although my own music can’t be really considered “electronic,” I have a few names on my radar who inspire me immensely. Fellow Dutchie Jameszoo is one of them. His album Fool on Brainfeeder is big time. Talking ‘bout non-conventional song structures and composing!
“Flake” is a perfect opener for the album. And a perfect opener for an early morning, too. I love how it starts: unorganized, with several elements, that come and go later during the song. Bird sounds, lasers, percussion, and after a while that extremely catchy synth melody. This is enviable good. It makes me want to go straight to the music lab to brew something new!**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Thijsenterprise – Never Stop Jumping Fences
Sarah: **"**I discovered Bonnie Banane, with the song "[L'Appétit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMbMJE0D4Dk)". I was immediately absorbed by his way of singing and his very particular style which makes it impossible to forget him. Then there were also his featuring with Chassol "[Feu au Lac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwKyMtTn30w)" and Myth Syzer & Ichon "[Le Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCV2YZOffJM)". On her debut album "[Sexy Planet](https://bonniebanane.bandcamp.com/album/sexy-planet)", released last November, I discovered a Bonnie Banane on the edge of her skin, angry, joyful but always in her slightly offbeat and provocative style as we like it.**"**

## [Myth Syzer](http://mythsyzer.fr/) – Je suis venu te dire que je m'en vais 
Sarah: **"**Surprising is the word that came to me when I heard this Gainsbourg cover. Of course, the original is unbeatable but Myth Syzer manages to give a boost to this wonderful song with brio, which gives it a new youth.**"**

## [Triorität](https://muddy-monk.bandcamp.com/) – Bonopo
Sarah: **"**So many layers in this one, feels like a floating dream of synths and jazz piano.**"**

## [Gábor Szabó](https://www.facebook.com/yannichonmusic)– Half The Day Is The Night
Sarah: **"**This one comes off of my favorite Szabó album, Dreams (1968). Such a phenomenal jazz-crossover; it's a kaleidescope of sound: Szabó's traditional Hungarian influences melt together with Southeast Asian folk riffs, both tied into soft-swaying samba movements paired with ever-evolving jazz structures. Szabó is absolutely effortless, this whole track moves like silk.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [Bonnie Banane](https://bonniebanane.bandcamp.com/releases) for her Sunday selections and to [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr/) for this episode's brilliant illustration!</p>
