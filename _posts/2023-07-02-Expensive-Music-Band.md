<p id="introduction"> This Sunday we welcome Expensive Music Band for Episode 531 :) </p>

# Expensive Music Band's selection

## [Dolthom](https://feedingtuberecords.bandcamp.com/album/frame-slip) - Ragui
Expensive Music Band: **"**This is a collaboration between Gary War and Rob from [Sunburned Hand of the Man](https://sunburnedhandoftheman.bandcamp.com/). For me this is the perfect side A- Sunday morning record. It's how I want to start my day feeling like I have just travelled to hades and back. It's winter here in Australia and cold on the south coast and I usually listen to this after swimming in shark approved waters in the rain. The attention to textures and the way the different movements move in and out of one another fully compliment my halloumi and zucchini frittata or whatever culinary dish I horribly disfigured and forced my family to eat.**"**

## [Solo Career](https://solocareer.bandcamp.com/track/renaissance) - Renaissance
Expensive Music Band: **"**Annabel Blackman is the writer, producer, singer and player of everything on this album. She is the lead axe in the very excellent Body Type and a key collaborator and all round buddy in EMB. She is just one of those ridiculously talented pop savants who should be writing for some pop idol but would rather hustle you for your coin with her pool shark skills. In this song she is calling for a renaissance while a beautiful ostinato flute sound hypnotises you and before you know it a million fragments seep into the song and then the song ends suddenly and you're left lying on the floor in the foetal position because you never wanted the song to end.**"**

## [Versis](https://versis.bandcamp.com/track/la-tierra) - LA TiERRA
Expensive Music Band: **"**I've listened to this song everyday since its release and it always gets me through life's little challenges. I'm at the stage in my life where my parents are getting a little bit older and I am taking on more responsibility in their care and at the same time I have this beautiful newborn baby that's an amazing gift but also needs a lot of my attention and sometimes you just worry you're not going to be able to keep those plates spinning. This song talks about a young man going through some life adjustments and questions whether or not he will be able to work it out and implores others "to show love in the land" and everytime I get upset about something trivial like being cut off in traffic or someone being hideous to me, I just blast this and know I am gonna get through.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Expensive Music Band](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/album/any-day-now) - I Think I Lost That Love
Sarah: **"**r mccarthy's weaving synth work throughout this track shifts and builds so effortlessly, it seems to hover in air. The sparse percussives and hovering synth harmonies slide alongside each other with so much grace -- engulfing us in blanketed textures woven into soft vocals. The slightly distorted lead synth toward the track's end flows so well across the walls of rounded synth harmonies below it, it's entrancing. The rest of the [2017 release](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/album/dick-arkive-issue-2)continues this balanced freshness in production, look out for [Jyoti](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/track/jyoti) :).**"**

## [Omni Gardens](https://omnigardens.bandcamp.com/) - Algae After All
Sarah: **"**This track brings us to another world, brimming with the filminess of green underwater flora, stretching upwards to a speckled surface in the distance. I used this track in my play for brainscape and aquascaping scenes, the harmonies here transport you to the swaying micro worlds of green and growth. (side note: r mccarthy's [Jyoti](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/track/jyoti) also featured to give a sounded body to this otherworldly space). The synth work's exploratory melody along with the droning hums of these undertones feel healing in some sense, like you're growing roots and new leaves just by listening to it -- living a newfound peaceful life as a patch of algae :)**"**

## [Paul Lansky](https://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/compositions-sorted.html) - Her Voice
Sarah: **"**On our last class of the semester, my music professor introduced us to Paul Lansky's [exploratory](http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/liner_notes/fantasies.html) 1994 album, [Fantasies and Tableaux](https://www.newworldrecords.org/products/paul-lansky-fantasies-and-tableaux). This is the first track off the release, and after listening through the rest of the collection, it's still my favorite ([Her Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lppSwmBBmOk) is a close second). The production process here is interesting, Paul Lansky uses his wife's voice as a technical instrument for the entire piece (bassline, chords, etc.), producing some of the synthwork with linear predictive coding. I love the haunting quality of his resulting product, approaching the uncanny valley of voice but still with the underlying romantic context to make me smile.**"**

## [Elori Saxl](https://elorisaxl.bandcamp.com/album/the-blue-of-distance) - Moss II
Sarah: **"**The fleeting power and playfulness of the sax sways in conversation with itself, at once ancient and evolving. I am reminded, maybe by the title, of my favorite recurring dream, where the moss reclaims me into its beautiful humming world of green. (Patches of carpet moss, strictly speaking... there's a film of mist all around and overhead, hosting a peaceful and insulated string of moments -- the moss has little green hands that embrace my arms as if it's been ages, and all that can be seen are these bright green stretches of softness welcoming me back... the image might be from reading too much Seamus Heaney, especially [this poem](https://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/poems/heaney/personal_helicon.php) and the last stanza of [this one](https://irelandtour.sunygeneseoenglish.org/resources/poems/heaneys-the-strand-at-lough-beg/).) Elori Saxl's epic arrives from [Touchtheplants](https://www.touchtheplants.com/pages/info)' 2021 album [Sound Wonders: A Series of Epics](https://www.touchtheplants.com/products/sound-wonders-lp), a compilation that includes several other wonderful artists including harpist [Nailah Hunter](https://nailahhunter.bandcamp.com/) and [SK Kakraba](https://skkakraba.bandcamp.com/). Elori Saxl's [description](https://www.touchtheplants.com/products/sound-wonders-lp) of her contribution in the album's release details a certain binding to the moss, where she explains how she felt, sitting on a bed of moss in a shaded forrest, that "the world was pulsing all around me and I never wanted it to end" but she also was "very aware that it was already slipping away."**"**
