<p id="introduction">This morning, our guest Juliette Armanet accompanies us on a journey of heart felt tempos and spiced sentiments."Douceur", if there is one word any non -native French speaker needs to know, it truly is that one. Douceur is the DNA of Juliette Armanet’s voice, like an opium injection distributed at the entrance of a feathered festival hosted by a unicorn floating on a cloud. Juliette’s essence is that of a rose petal blowing through the wind, ever so slowly, landing on the wing of spring’s first butterfly. As each of her fingers taps the piano’s keys, your heart will beat, pulsing gently, pumping love blood through your entire body. “L’amour en solitaire” is a ballade through a forest of sentiments, but also an ode to the creative power of solitude, the intensity that can be felt when a single individual expresses nothing but the truth. A sincere and humble thank you to the universe for sending us such bliss, as spring awaits to open its gates, get ready to embark on a journey of love to the decadent soundtrack of Juliette Armanet’s music.</p>

# Juliette’s selection

“I was up for a casual sweatshirt Sunday or like a thick pullover made of Chihuahua fur, a hot hot cocoa chocolate, croissants in a flower arrangement and shaggy hair.
Next time, I’ll go for the dynamic Sunday, fluo sneakers, vitamin-loaded smoothie and an ironed mini-short”

## Ricky Hollywood - Prie pour Moi

“A quiet and very original delight…The intro is kind of deep, a little dark even but the song lightens up gradually. A pop gem, intensely moving and that puts a spell on you, coming from an artist whose humour I really like… What a voice and those lyrics!
Aside from his own project, he plays the drums with me and we have a lot of fun together. That Ricky!

## Infinite Bisous - Teen Sex

“One of the sexiest songs out these days, produced by a young and utterly charming Brit named Rory Mac Carthy, (he played alongside Connan Moccasin for a few years). His project “Infinite Bisous” is very dear to me. It’s very delicate and distinguished. It’s quite bare, the song is stripped back, throbbing, perfectly produced and sounds like an adorably erotic classic”.

## Ojard -  Les Machines Parlantes

This song feels like an old seventies cinema instrumental track, to which you see yourself wandering naked by a small stream with a flower between your teeth. This outer worldly flute is beautiful, sounding like a timeless nursery rhyme. I’m not very knowledgeable about this artist, but his tune crafting and his musical landscapes are very pleasing to me. On this note, I have to go, and dance, adorning a mouthful of daisies. Enjoy your Sunday, and take it easy. Give peace a chance.”
