<p id="introduction"> This morning, 
<br><br>
Reference to Skinshape's episode [MailTape 353](https://www.mailta.pe/353/skinshape/)
Tanguy from Corte Real
</p>


# Corte Real's selection


## Leonard Cohen - I Left A Woman Waiting
Tanguy: **"**This jewel of a song would be quite welcome to awaken to on a Sunday morning. Spector’s music emanates sorrow, but the musical notes manage to bring some rays of light. The world would be a much better place if all would rise to the sound of this song.**"**

## Bert Jansch - In My Mind
Tanguy: **"**Bert Jansch’s song bathes us into a bucolic vibe. Truth be told, I rarely listen to music upon waking, but  if it were the case I would certainly enjoy stumbling upon such a song. It makes you feel like sliding into your rubber boots and mowing the lawn, which never happens to me.**"**

## Ali Daniel - La Nuit Qui Vient
Tanguy: **"**This one reminds me a bit of France. It radiates something quite soft that is truly beautiful. I don’t quite know why but it reminds me of the Côte d’Azur: A chair, a coffee and some waves.**"**
