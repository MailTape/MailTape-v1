<p id="introduction"> This morning, 
<br><br>
Reference to Skinshape's episode [MailTape 353](https://www.mailta.pe/353/skinshape/)
Tanguy from Corte Real
</p>


# Corte Real's selection


## Leonard Cohen - I Left A Woman Waiting
Tanguy: **"**This jewel of a song would be quite welcome to awaken to on a Sunday morning. Spector’s music emanates sorrow, but the musical notes manage to bring some rays of light. The world would be a much better place if all would rise to the sound of this song.**"**

## Bert Jansch - In My Mind
Tanguy: **"**Bert Jansch’s song bathes us into a bucolic vibe. Truth be told, I rarely listen to music upon waking, but  if it were the case I would certainly enjoy stumbling upon such a song. It makes you feel like sliding into your rubber boots and mowing the lawn, which never happens to me.**"**

## [Ali Daniel](https://www.alidanel.fr/) - La Nuit Qui Vient
Tanguy: **"**This one reminds me a bit of France. It radiates something quite soft that is truly beautiful. I don’t quite know why but it reminds me of the Côte d’Azur: A chair, a coffee and some waves.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Corte Real](https://www.facebook.com/corterealmusic/) - Pays Vaincu
Jules: **"****"**

## [Philémon Cimon](https://philemoncimon.bandcamp.com/) - Les Pommiers Envahis
Jules: **"****"**

## OHIO - Ohio
Jules: **"**"Upward, Broken, Always" is the debut album from [OHIO](https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/upward-broken-always), a duo comprised of Taylor Deupree, founder of the New York based experimental music label [12k](https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/), and long-time collaborator Corey Fuller. This record is born from the separate childhood memories of their home state. The eponymous track is a slowed cover of Damien Jurado’s 1999 folk song. This new version featuring vocals from Fuller and a beautiful improvisational interlude creates a melancholic, dreamy and subtle atmosphere that will chase all the morning clouds.**"**

## The Velvet Underground - I Found A Reason
Jules: **"**I had almost forgotten this song before Massive Attack did a cover version, as an opening to their concert in Paris last February. How could I have forgotten the voice of Lou Reed flying over the chorus and the heavenly atmosphere created by these guitar notes?**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always thank you so much for listening. Much love and respect to Tanguy from [Corte Real](https://www.facebook.com/corterealmusic/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for her brilliant illustration.</p>
