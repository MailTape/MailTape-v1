# DJ Yoda's selection


## O.C. - Burn Me Slow
DJ Yoda: **"**O.C. is a super under-rated rapper to me, he's kind of like an even more underground Nas. He's got a huge catalogue of amazing music, but I'm a real sucker for any hip-hop beats with pianos, so this says Sunday morning to me.**"**

## The Gap Band - Yearning For Your Love
DJ Yoda: **"**I love 80s soul. I have a whole alter ego that I dedicate to this kind of music. ("[Sparkle Motion](https://sparkle-motion.bandcamp.com/releases)" - look it up!). This was famously sampled by Nas on "Life's A Bitch", but the original is just as good, if not better.**"**

## Lightnin' Hopkins - Too Many Drivers
DJ Yoda: **"**My go-to listening at the moment is very old blues. I like the primitive recording quality of all this stuff - it sounds of an era, and it really takes you somewhere. I listen to a lot of bluesy/film soundtrack stuff too. No beats at all is sometimes a good antidote to a Saturday night of a lot of beats.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## DJ Yoda - Roxbury (feat. Edo.G and Nubya Garcia)
Jules: **"****"**

## CunninLynguists - Remember Me (Abstract/Reality)
Jules: **"**[CunninLynguists](https://cunninlynguists.bandcamp.com/music)**"**

## Blind MIC - Really On
Jules: **"**[Blind MIC](soundcloud.com/mikebaines) **"**

## Wilma Vritra - Harness
Jules: **"**[Wilma Vritra](https://wilmavritra.bandcamp.com/)**"**
