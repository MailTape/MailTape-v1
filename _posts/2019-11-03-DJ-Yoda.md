# DJ Yoda's selection


## Benny Soebardja & Lizard - Candlelight
DJ Yoda: **"**There are a few reasons I chose the Benny Soebarja & Lizard track. The first reason is I love how healing and relaxed the track starts out, super pleasant for morning activity. The second is the vocal. I always tend to gravitate towards both male and female husky vocalist. With a voice like that, you don't have to do much. I also just dig the lyrics and song form.**"**

## CAN - Mary, Mary, So Contrary
DJ Yoda: **"**I can't list all the reasons I chose this record but i'll list a couple. First is the way CAN interacts with each other, they have a looseness and freedom that  I can definitely appreciate, I feel like I'm missing those aspects in music now. Second is Malcolm Mooney's raspy and girthy voice, another one who can just sing the melody and not have to do anything else. He's one of the few baritones I can hear sing all day.**"**

## ARP - Fluorescences
DJ Yoda: **"**[ARP](https://arpetc.bandcamp.com/) is an artist I discovered a couple of years ago and I'm learning that this guy has been putting out records for quite some time now, everything I've heard is sweet. This track in particular just gets my ideas flowing and I love marimba. They did an incredible job recording the drums too.**"**
