# Mansfield.TYA's selection

## [Anika](https://anika.bandcamp.com/album/anika) - I go to sleep
Mansfield.TYA: **"**Also sung by The pretenders, and originally written and composed by Ray Davies for the Kinks, I like the versatility of this song.
And particularly the version of Anika.
With her beautiful deep voice that reminds Nico, and recorded with Beak, only that.
Always classy Anika.

To fight against insomnia.
For her dark and intimate side too.

"I go to sleep, and imagine that you're there with me."

To be imaginative.
It seems precious to me at the moment.**"**

## [Erykah Badu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erykah_Badu) - I been going thru it all
Mansfield.TYA: **"**I am totally stupid with this track.
It's Odezenne who play it at parties and when I hear it I want to bang my head into a concrete wall.
I love Erykah Badu Beyond, but I must admit that I was stunned to hear her mixing with Trap.
She knows how to do everything, she's an incredible melodist on top of being a great singer.**"**

## [Lena Platonos](https://lenaplatonos.bandcamp.com/) - Markos
Mansfield.TYA: **"**It's a song that gets me.
I know Carla likes it a lot too.
I think it's about a man who is treated like a dog.
Lena Platonos is a Greek composer (born in Crete) and a big name in 80's electronic music.
Like many women she is not recognized at her true value.**"**
