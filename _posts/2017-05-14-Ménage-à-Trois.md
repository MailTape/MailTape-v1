On a Sunday morning I would like to wake up with this track first;
ocean-edits-this-old-heart-of-mine-rod-stewart

for a mellow start to wake up slowly to and to soothe any hangover from the night before, let the soothing tines wash over your tired brain

June - Lost Area (Dj Sprinkles' Empty Dancefoor)

then this for memories of the weekend, but presented in a more palatable manner for a sunday morning
"you made it" positive rammifications of the empty dancefloor

and finally for memories of summers past at MIDI festival in Hyeres, a cover of the classic Durutti Column track. A release by a boutique label from Manchester who also released "Conditional Love" a few years ago on one of the compilation E.Ps.
