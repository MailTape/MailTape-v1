<p id="introduction">Bright and delightful morning to the masses and the listeners, to the frequency lovers and addicted souls of the music empire. Today, [Ménage à Trois](https://www.facebook.com/threesistersinlove/) will tickle you with their harmonious selection and singular sound.</p>

# Ménage à Trois' selection

**"**On a Sunday morning I would like to wake up with this track first**"**

## Rod Stewart - This Old Heart Of Mine (Ocean Edits)

_Ménage à Trois_: **"**For a mellow start to wake up slowly to and to soothe any hangover from the night before, let the soothing tines wash over your tired brain**"**

## June - Lost Area (Dj Sprinkles' Empty Dancefoor)
_Ménage à Trois_: **"**then this for memories of the weekend, but presented in a more palatable manner for a sunday morning "you made it" positive rammifications of the empty dancefloor**"**

## Dream Lovers - For Belgian Friends
_Ménage à Trois_: **"**and finally for memories of summers past at MIDI festival in Hyeres, a cover of the classic Durutti Column track. A release by a boutique label from Manchester who also released "Conditional Love" a few years ago on one of the compilation E.Ps.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Ménage à Trois - All Night Long
_Dimitri_: **"** This song will make you feel nostalgic like if it was your last night of your first holiday romance.**"**

## Babeheaven — Heaven
_Dimitri_: **"**They make you a promise and they've fulfill it. Very chill and relax, let this london based band guide you to the seven heaven. Do we want more in a sunday ? **"**

## Blue Of Noon — Guidance
_Dimitri_: **"**Guidance is a pleasant piece of dreamy surf-pop with an assumed melancholy that lets you catch a glimpse of beautiful summer prospects.**"**

## Dave Depper - Do You Want Love?
_Dimitri_: **"**Yes, I do.**"**
