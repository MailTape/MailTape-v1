  This morning, we are delighted to welcome Parisian-based DJ and producer DJ
  Lycox to share with us a Sunday morning selection full of energy. No excuses
  to sleep in!  My first encounter with DJ Lycox's music was like an electric
  shock, when I first listened to his EP "Kizas do Ly". Like the other artists
  of the Lisbon-based record label PRÍNCIPE, the Portuguese producer made me
  discover melodies, rhythms that I didn't know well and that I thought I didn't
  like. The same applies for this selection which overflows with energy and
  cannot leave indifferent: you have to dare to go beyond your first reactions
  to discover all the richness and the complexity of Lycox's musical universe.

<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are delighted to welcome Parisian-based DJ and producer [DJ Lycox](https://www.facebook.com/dlycox/) to share with us a Sunday morning selection full of energy. No excuses to sleep in!
<br><br>
My first encounter with DJ Lycox's music was like an electric shock, when I first listened to his EP ["Kizas do Ly"](https://principediscos.bandcamp.com/album/kizas-do-ly). Like the other artists of the Lisbon-based record label PRÍNCIPE, the Portuguese producer made me discover melodies, rhythms that I didn't know well and that I thought I didn't like. The same applies for this selection which overflows with energy and cannot leave indifferent: you have to dare to go beyond your first reactions to discover all the richness and the complexity of Lycox's musical universe.

# DJ Lycox's selection

## Chief Keef - Faneto
DJ Lycox: **"**This sound works for me as vitamins such is the energy that the music itself offers me. Don’t matter if the day is strange or beautiful, Faneto is always going to put me in a good mood.**"**

## Pop Smoke - Hawk Em
DJ Lycox: **"**This one is special because since we lost this icon of the drill scene I can't stop listening to his sounds, and this one in particular propels me to unleash the gangsta inside of me.**"**

## Chief Keef & Lil Reese - I Don't Like
DJ Lycox: **"**Usually the Sundays for me are quite calm and boring, and I am a person that enjoys being quiet and serene but not in the morning, so I Don’t Like is the alarm clock jam here in the house.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [DJ Lycox](https://www.facebook.com/dlycox/) - Solteiro
Jules: **"**Like for other PRÍNCIPE's producers, we find in Lycox's music his kuduro and kizomba influences, as well as these crazy and complex percussions which made me discover a new way of dancing, more physical. But beyond that, he stands out with its aerial and melancholic melodies that have something special and which make you want to escape too. And right now we absolutely need it.**"**

## Anz - Loos In Twos (NRG)
Jules: **"**With this track opening her last EP released last September, the Manchester-based DJ and producer [Anz](https://anzdj.bandcamp.com/) delivers a sequence of kicks and drums as well suited for the dancefloors as to liven up your morning exercise.**"**

## Azu Tiwaline - Terremer
Jules: **"**Let's calm down now, it's time to dive to the bottom of the ocean or, failing that, its bathtub. Here the percussions of the Tunisian producer [Azu Tiwaline](https://azutiwaline.bandcamp.com/) are slower and have a hypnotizing effect that takes us somewhere between the sea and the desert, between shadow and light.**"**

## Beatrice Dillon - Workaround Two
Jules: **"**Drums, more drums, always drums. Here the work of the UK-based rhythm-obsessive musician and DJ [Beatrice Dillon](https://beatricedillon.bandcamp.com/) perfectly combines with Laurel Halo's vocals as well as acoustic samples from a wide range of guests to embark you on an innovative trip.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [DJ Lycox](https://www.facebook.com/dlycox/) for his Sunday selections, and many thanks to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration!</p>
