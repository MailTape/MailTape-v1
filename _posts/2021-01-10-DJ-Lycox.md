# DJ Lycox's selection

## Chief Keef - Faneto
DJ Lycox: **"**This sound works for me as vitamins such is the energy that the music itself offers me. Don’t matter if the day is strange or beautiful, Faneto is always going to put me in a good mood.**"**

## Pop Smoke - Hawk Em
DJ Lycox: **"**This one is special because since we lost this icon of the drill scene I can't stop listening to his sounds, and this one in particular propels me to unleash the gangsta inside of me.**"**

## Chief Keef & Lil Reese - I Don't Like
DJ Lycox: **"**Usually the Sundays for me are quite calm and boring, and I am a person that enjoys being quiet and serene but not in the morning, so I Don’t Like is the alarm clock jam here in the house.**"**
