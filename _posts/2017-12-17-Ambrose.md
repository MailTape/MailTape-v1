<p id="introduction">This morning, forget all about winter and warm up with [Ambrose](https://www.facebook.com/weareambrose/)’s sensual selection. French band Ambrose is composed of Félicie and Alexandre, who mix different influences to create romantic tracks, oscillating between electro-pop and groovy r'n'b.
They released their second [EP](https://soundcloud.com/ambr-se/sets/ambrose-romance-ep) a month ago, and for those in Paris, they're having a [release party](https://www.facebook.com/events/1942581355955933/) next Friday!</p>
<p>So slow your pace this morning. Take your time. Feel magnificent. Impressive. Sublime.</p>



# Ambrose's selection

## Basile Di Manski - The Story of a Magnificient Blowjob
_Ambrose_: **"**Basile’s groove and sensuality are widely recognised, we love him a lot. He has remixed [Romance](http://bit.ly/remixbasile), it is a real gem!**"**

## Mac DeMarco - One More Love Song
_Ambrose_: **"**We talk a lot about Mac DeMarco among us. His fake casualness, his sensitivity, and his unconditional coolness of course. He has obviously been an inspiration, particularly for the guitars on our track [Keesee](https://soundcloud.com/ambr-se/ambrose-keesee-mix) 👌**"**

## Brandy & Monica - The Boy Is Mine
_Ambrose_: **"**Big R'n'B influence in our EP as well with the most classic of classics that we will cover live in a special way, surprise surprise 💣**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Ambrose - Keesee
_Inès_: **"**I discovered Ambrose two years ago with [Le Dernier Homme](https://soundcloud.com/ambr-se/le-dernier-homme) and fell in love with their [first EP](https://soundcloud.com/ambr-se/sets/ambrose-ep). Now they’re back with a beautiful second EP, and Keesee is a slow, blissful track with an amazing ending.**"**

## Letherette - Anal Sax
_Inès_: **"**Let's go down the groovy road with this very cool two-minute almost-instrumental track. A perfect transitional tune for this selection.**"**

## Lomboy - Loverboy
_Inès_: **"**Hypnotic, powerful and luxurious. Plush atmosphere condensed in a song.**"**

## Moodoïd - Reptile
_Inès_: **"**My current musical obsession. Funky, sexy, groovy, ultra catchy... an immediate motivator.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks a lot for listening! Big thanks to [Ambrose](https://www.facebook.com/weareambrose/) for being our guest this morning, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's illustration. Have a delightful Sunday!</p>
