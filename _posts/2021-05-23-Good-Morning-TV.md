<p id="introduction">This morning,</p>


# Good Morning TV's selection

## Surface to air Missive - Time being
Good Morning TV: ** **That song stuck with me every morning of the first quarantine here, which almost literally was a month of Sundays… I loved the strangely calm energy of it, the perfect amount of energy to do nothing but sip coffee, sunbathing on the ledge of my kitchen window. Always warding off the boredom with unexpected structures and melodies, and filling the mind with comforting thoughts.** **


## Art Feynman - I'm Gonna Miss Your World
Good Morning TV: ** **I like this song because it’s both immediate and complex. Writing a simple song on which everybody can dance to and anybody can sing isn’t an easy job. It’s also a kind of « love song », in a very unique and discreet way.** **

## Ryuichi Sakamoto - Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence
Good Morning TV: ** **This is the kind of song everyone feels it has been written for them. There’s such parsimony in the melody, such refinement in the interpretation that you almost fear breaking it by listening too loud. Officially it goes on 5’31, but it could well last days, years even. It’s a perfect song that wakes you up softly and then, without warning, puts you back to sleep. It’s a perfect song to wake up softly and then, without warning, fall back to sleep.** **
