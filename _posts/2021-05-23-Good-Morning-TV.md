<p id="introduction">This morning,</p>


# Good Morning TV's selection

## Surface to air Missive - Time being
Good Morning TV: **"**That song stuck with me every morning of the first quarantine here, which almost literally was a month of Sundays… I loved the strangely calm energy of it, the perfect amount of energy to do nothing but sip coffee, sunbathing on the ledge of my kitchen window. Always warding off the boredom with unexpected structures and melodies, and filling the mind with comforting thoughts.**"**


## Art Feynman - I'm Gonna Miss Your World
Good Morning TV: **"**I like this song because it’s both immediate and complex. Writing a simple song on which everybody can dance to and anybody can sing isn’t an easy job. It’s also a kind of « love song », in a very unique and discreet way.**"**

## Ryuichi Sakamoto - Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence
Good Morning TV: **"**This is the kind of song everyone feels it has been written for them. There’s such parsimony in the melody, such refinement in the interpretation that you almost fear breaking it by listening too loud. Officially it goes on 5’31, but it could well last days, years even. It’s a perfect song that wakes you up softly and then, without warning, puts you back to sleep. It’s a perfect song to wake up softly and then, without warning, fall back to sleep.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Good Morning TV - Insomnia
Anaïs G: **"**It is by texturing the sound, that Bérénice Deloire manages to identify this very special name that we find when we listen to Good Morning Tv. A somewhat psychedelic side, which is very similar to the shoegaze. While waiting to be able to listen to their album “Small Talk”, which will be released in June under the label Géographie, let’s savour this chill-to-max sound for a cocooning Sunday.**"**

## Melody's Echoe Chamber - Shiram
Anaïs G: **"**I discovered this artist in 2012 with the release of her first self-titled album. A psychedelic, intimate, soft and pastel atmosphere with songs like “I Follow You” or “Crystillised”, which are amazing! His second opus “Bon Voyage” was released in 2018 by Domino Records co and Fat Possum Records. This time -Here Melody’s Echoe Chamber bet on guitar riffs in addition to the psychedelic side which gives a very nice rock side to his music. “Shiram” is my favorite of the second EP!**"**

## Laventure - Give
Anaïs G: **** Groupe strasbourgeois ****

## Poni Hoax - Tropical Suite: São Paulo
Anaïs G: **"**I had to finish this plylist with a title by the best French rock band of the 2000s, Poni Hoax. More than a band, their songs resonated in our minds like the title “Antibodies” and others. So it’s a tribute to the members of this band but especially to the singer Nicolas Ker, who left us this week. This walk from their album “Tropical Suite” released in 2017, by Pan European Records, makes us hover in a stratosphere.**"**
