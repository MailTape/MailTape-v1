<p id="introduction"> This morning, 
<br><br>

</p>


# u.r.trax's selection

## Unklevon - Sharping Shadow
u.r.trax: **"**Unklevon is a French producer I really admire. He has the secret to make classy yet energetic electro bangers. Often, he adds a bit of his voice and it always works ! Lately, I've been opening my sets a lot with this track : very sexy and versatile. It oscillates between uplifting pads, impactant vocals and a very straightforward beat.**"**

## Eartheater, Tony Seltzer - Joyride
u.r.trax: **"**Eartheater is a siren whispering to your ear. This artist's sonic range sweeps from ambient to trap and hyperpop. Her singing is so particular, and becomes even more magical when blended to futuristic productions. I've been obsessed with Joyride ever since it came out. Her voice makes me feel so many things !**"**

## Sentimental Rave - Unreleased Love
u.r.trax: **"**Sentimental Rave is maybe the artist with the purest soul i've ever met. First time I heard her live, she finished her set with one of her productions and I cried (lol). Her work on textures, rhythms, and her production methods are really impressive. But, the most amazing thing is how she sends pure emotion the second you listen to her tracks. The melody in this track almost reminds me of classical music !**"**
