  This morning, we are delighted to welcome u.r.trax to MailTape, for an
  energetic Sunday morning selection!  It's time to get out of bed, or it's not
  yet time to go to bed, time to go out for a jog or go shouting at a
  demonstration. Anyway, the Parisian DJ and techno music producer, who is never
  mentioned in the media without recalling her young age and her precocity, has
  energy to spare. u.r.trax's music cultivates the paradox between introspective
  themes that evoke a generational existential crisis, as in her EP MORAL
  KRISIS, and rhythms designed for large dark dancefloors which, in the time of
  health restrictions, sound like calls for action.

It's time to get out of bed, or it's not yet time to go to bed, time to go out for a jog or go shouting at a demonstration. Anyway, the Parisian DJ and techno music producer, who is never mentioned in the media without recalling her young age and her precocity, has energy to spare. u.r.trax's music cultivates the paradox between introspective themes that evoke a generational existential crisis, as in her EP [MORAL KRISIS](https://hectoroaks.bandcamp.com/album/moral-krisis), and rhythms designed for large dark dancefloors which, in the time of health restrictions, sound like calls for action.

# u.r.trax's selection

## Unklevon - Sharping Shadow
u.r.trax: **"**Unklevon is a French producer I really admire. He has the secret to make classy yet energetic electro bangers. Often, he adds a bit of his voice and it always works ! Lately, I've been opening my sets a lot with this track : very sexy and versatile. It oscillates between uplifting pads, impactant vocals and a very straightforward beat.**"**

## Eartheater, Tony Seltzer - Joyride
u.r.trax: **"**Eartheater is a siren whispering to your ear. This artist's sonic range sweeps from ambient to trap and hyperpop. Her singing is so particular, and becomes even more magical when blended to futuristic productions. I've been obsessed with Joyride ever since it came out. Her voice makes me feel so many things !**"**

## Sentimental Rave - Unreleased Love
u.r.trax: **"**Sentimental Rave is maybe the artist with the purest soul i've ever met. First time I heard her live, she finished her set with one of her productions and I cried (lol). Her work on textures, rhythms, and her production methods are really impressive. But, the most amazing thing is how she sends pure emotion the second you listen to her tracks. The melody in this track almost reminds me of classical music !**"**


# MailTape's selection

## u.r.trax - Race Against The Time
Jules: **"**Taken from u.r.trax's new EP ["U R TRA$H"](https://lobstertheremin.com/album/u-r-tra-h), released in September 2021 on the London-based label Lobster Theremin, this track, with its complex beat and its metallic and distressing synths, represents well the precocity, the desire and the urgency embodied by the music of the young Parisian producer. Maybe a little too hard for a Sunday morning, but do we still have time anyway?**"**

## [Simo Cell](https://simocell.bandcamp.com/) - Whispers
Jules: **"**This track is an extract of the album "YES.DJ" released in September 2021. This album, published on Simo Cell's own label TEMÆŽT, is another celebration of dance music, dancefloors and DJing. While the clubs are once again closed, the concerts canceled and the artists in uncertainty, the French DJ/producer makes us explore here different styles of beats. Time to think of your new dance moves fro 2022.**"**

## [Bambounou](https://bambounouofficial.bandcamp.com/) - Final Conference
Jules: **"**2021 has been an important year for the Parisian DJ and producer Bambounou, with the launch of his new label Bambe. The first releases with imprints of ambient and tribal sounds, as well as the aesthetic of the label, represent well the new mature and resolutely modern space wanted by Bambounou, and impressed and inspired me a lot this year.**"**

## Asna - Atalaku
Jules: **"**Last (but not least) of my great discoveries of last year, this track released on the label ["BLANC MANIOC"](https://blancmanioclabel.bandcamp.com/track/atalaku), a label exclusively dedicated to modern African electronic music which turned my head and my body up and down.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to u.r.trax for her energizing Sunday selections, and many thanks to Meriam Kherbat for this episode's stunning illustration !</p>
