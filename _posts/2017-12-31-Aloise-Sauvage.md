<p id="introduction">This morning, it's time to reflect on the past year. Hell, last January is so far away! It's a new milestone for MailTape: one more year of introducing you to the music we love, the music that inspires us — and hopefully, that inspires you.</p>
<p>I'm delighted to offer you the last tape of 2017, especially with Aloïse Sauvage as our guest. Aloïse Sauvage is my own revelation of the year. She released her first track in September, and her music has cast a spell on my brain. I'm glad to introduce you to this amazing artist.</p>
<p>She's a singer, dancer, actress... You might have seen her in 120 BPM, Romain Campillo's movie (Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival) and now you will discover that everything she touches is pure magic.</p>

# Aloïse Sauvage's selection


## Nicholas Britell — End Credits Suite (Moonlight Soundtrack)
_Aloïse Sauvage_: **"**This track comes from the movie Moonlight's score. I saw the movie and I was really touched by it, and I looked up the soundtrack to listen to it all over again. I really like film scores. I feel like the choise of it is of prime importance to sublime the movie where it interfere.
<p>Also, I chose this track because I listen to it when I need to write. It takes me to a melancolic (but combative!) state of mind and helps me bring my thoughts to paper in a spontaneous and honest way.</p>
<p>And I love these parts where string and brass instruments meet. To me, it feels like this track has something... divine (?)**"**</p>

## Jaden Smith — E
_Aloïse Sauvage_: **"**"E" is a track from Jaden Smith's last album "SYRE". It's the last part of a song split in four tracks ("B", "L", "U" and "E").
<p>I really enjoyed this album. I think that Jaden Smith has reached an impressive artistic maturity for his age. I like his flow and the musical and rhythmic division in the songs. He allows himself to play outside of usual structures of songs like "verse/chorus/verse".</p>
<p>I like to be lost listening to the album and not knowing if the track changed or not. He creates a coherent and smooth whole in which we can dive in. So I dive in willingly. All in blue. Lost in my dreams, running on clouds.**"**</p>

## Feu! Chatterton — L'Ivresse
_Aloïse Sauvage_: **"**I love this song, I listen to it like a drug these days. Is that L'Ivresse? Its power on me is double : I can listen to it, eyes closed, and ramble in my thoughts... Or I can dance to it wildly and my body goes nuts. This track makes me want to rush, strongly, into life, in my projects and my wishes.
<p>I love the words, the freedom of tone and how the singer, Arthur, is singing ("phrasing" ?), paired with the singular and captiving music of the whole band. It feels like a spoonful of honey in the mouth. Also, I don't drink, but this song kind of makes me want to be drunk... with happiness! Perfect to finish off 2017 and start 2018 right! Thanks Feu! Chatterton!**"**</p>


# MailTape's selection

## Aloïse Sauvage — Ailleurs Higher
_Louise_: **"**When I first discovered Aloïse Sauvage, it was with Ailleurs Higher's video clip. I was blown away by her phrasing and the way she moved amazed me — learning later that she's a professional dancer, that made sense. Ailleurs Higher has something peculiar that I can't really describe, but to me, it's a hit.**"**

## Blu Samu — Latenight freestyle
_Louise_: **"****"**

## Baba Ali — Cog in the wheel
_Louise_: **"****"**

## rAHHH — Ends
_Louise_: **"****"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! </p>
