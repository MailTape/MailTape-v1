<p id="introduction"> This morning, we welcome you in the world of edits and universal music. In this parralel world, productor fell in love of old musics heritages, and decide to bring them back to life. As magicians or gods, they bring back to us their deep inspiration. We can only admire them, because without those gold diggers, our local musical scenes would be much more ethnocentric. In a way they contribute to restore our world heritage.

Gramophile is a Parisian duo. As productor as djs, they create an exotic universe that warm up every parisian Dancefloor since three years now. Since they start to produce edits, they changed dimension. "Tamborito" is assurely their masterpiece.  </p>

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## Gramophiles - Tamborito
_Maxime_: **"** Tamborito get the charm of goods edits. At the first listen, you can be sure that the original song was recordings longtime ago and far far away, but The Gramophiles give it the perfect arrangement and mix to transform this panamean classic to a secret weapon for Djs.  **"**

+ ## Konono n°1 & Batida - Bom Dia
_Maxime_: **"** This song is excrat from one of the best album of this year, directly extract from the heart of Angola. This masterpiece is the result of the meeting of an old angolan group from the 70s,Konono n°1, and one of the best productor of the crazy actual lisbote scene, Batida. From this meeting results in an extrodinary travel across all Angolan traditionnal rhythms transformed into crazy beats.**"**

+ ## Alma Negra - Burkina Berlin
_Maxime_: **"** Alma Negra duet come from Switzerland, but nothing in their music remind us switzerland, even europe. Each of their tracks is a tribute to different music all around the world. Expecially tribal rhythms. For this one,everything is in the title !  **"**

+ ## Les Yeux Oranges - Coco
_Maxime_: **"** "Coco" is an edit of an french pop song from the eighties. A tropicalo-kitsch song that couldn't be forgoten by the actual night scene of Paris. I think "Coco" represent in its kind the Paris musical scene of 2016.  **"**
