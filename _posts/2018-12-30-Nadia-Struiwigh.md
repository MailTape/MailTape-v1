<p id="introduction">In this final episode of 2018, we are delighted to welcome Rotterdam-based DJ and electronic producer [Nadia Struiwigh](https://www.nadiastruiwigh.com/) as she picks three meditative Sunday morning tunes.
<br><br>
Her refined downtempo electronica takes you on a journey full of synthesised soundscapes that flirt with ambient techno. Music that feels like it was made for quiet nights and club-drowsy dawns.
<br><br>
For a quick recap on what we've been doing this year, what we're about and what we want to continue doing, [check out this blog post by Maxime](https://write.as/mailtape/). Available in English/disponible en français.</p>


# Nadia Struiwigh's selection

## [West Dylan Thordson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Dylan_Thordson) – Meeting the Others
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**This is a masterpiece in my eyes (ears?). I am a big fan of soundtracks and that is why I needed to include one soundtrack which is giving me goosebumps all over. This movie included many sync stories which I like in a movie and with this soundtrack I fell in love. In this life it is hard to be the “real” you...and this movie reminds me how many personalities we can have, even it is setup as a Thriller. James McAvoy “The beast” plays a magnificent and crazy role in this movie. The music reminds me of an epic hopeful emotional rollercoaster with an open end. Also...check out all the other tracks on this album.**"**

## Helios – It Was Warmer Then
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**Mostly I am into emotional pieces... I like to listen to these on a free Sunday. They make me feel warm and in balance. I like to meditate a lot and do yoga which relieves all the stress. [Helios](https://www.unseen-music.com/) created a balanced track which reminds me a bit of [Tycho](http://tychomusic.com/). The warm sounds with the playful rhythm that feels completely natural. It makes me happy also! The melodic string which comes in is reaching out to all my senses and makes me awake as well.**"**

## [Be Forest](https://beforest.bandcamp.com/) – Totem
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**When I heard this very short song for the first time...I went nuts. I truly love these kind of rhythms and the New Age sound. I grew up with the music of Enya and Pink Floyd stuff, so I love those reverby sounds. I also like the combination of electronic instruments and acoustic. I guess best of both worlds! It is very short...but that’s making it very special and gives the feeling you want more. That is the best I think.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Nadia Struiwigh – Roeiweijk
_Sanjay_: **"**Lovely downtempo and ambient vibes from today's guest, [Nadia Struiwigh](https://www.nadiastruiwigh.com/). Flirting with ambient techno, the drones and spaced out pads work well in slow, drawn out movements here.**"**

## Kara-Lis Coverdale – Vessels
_Sanjay_: **"**Uncompromisingly distinct while flickering with gentle optimism, this triptych for solo piano—written, performed and recorded by [Kara-Lis Coverdale](https://soundcloud.com/klissay)—illuminates unseen spaces that eventually gradient into nothingness.**"**

## Roslyn Steer – Busy Window
_Sanjay_: **"**I don't know a great deal about [Roslyn Steer](https://soundcloud.com/ros-steer)'s musical output, but this sounds like yet another welcome discovery from the ethereal contemporary music scene in Ireland.**"**

## Grouper – Being Her Shadow
_Sanjay_: **"**This track has all the things I've come to associate with [Grouper](http://www.repeatingpattern.com/), the solo project of musician Liz Harris: impressionistic, slightly 'out of focus' and replete with comfortingly indecipherable lyrics. Ultimately losing itself in a drifting, idyllic soundworld.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning and this year. As always thanks so much for listening to this episode, and to all our previous episodes in 2018.
