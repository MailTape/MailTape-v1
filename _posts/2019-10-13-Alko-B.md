<p id="introduction">This morning, nostalgia takes us, like a desire to go back, of lost softness, of odors disappeared .. But this morning I found the cure for the Sunday blues with the bad days fast approaching. Nothing like the music of [Alko B](https://soundcloud.com/alkomusicofficial) to remedy all this.  
  
<br><br>Subtle, calm and sensual, the music of this young musician and singer from Beirut is a caress for diffucult awake and rainyday. After being part of the band [The Wanton Bishops](https://thewantonbishops.com/) and skimming the stages with them, after having had an electro-pop project called [Loopstache](https://www.loopstache.com/), [Alko B](https://www.facebook.com/Alkobmusic/) took the time to compose for him to come up with a music that looks like him.<br><br>
</p>



# Alko B's selection

## Santo and Johnny – A Theme From A Summer Place
_Alko B_: **"**It’s a wonderful melody.. one of those where you say to yourself that you’d wish you had written.[Santo and Johnny](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_%26_Johnny) are a big inspiration to me, to my sound, this warmth they have created with they arrangements, the cranky lapsteel sound and the way it is performed is genius.**"**

## Los Indios Tabajaras – Maria Elena
_Alko B_: **"**I mean, try to wake up to this on a Sunday morning and you'll understand my choice.This is pure magic.**"**

## [Scott Walker](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Walker) - Duchess  
_Alko B_: **"**Paying tribute to this legend who passed away a few months ago. This song is a masterpiece. So many powerful emotions.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Alko B - Some Things
_Anaïs G_: **"**A minimalist artwork, with sounds likes [Mac DeMarco](https://www.facebook.com/MacDeMarcoBand/), nothing better  for a second album. The artist [Alko B](https://soundcloud.com/alkomusicofficial) forces us to take the time, to settle down and think of nothing but the present moment. Absolute love !**"**

## Anika - In The City
_Anaïs G_: **"**[Anika](https://www.stonesthrow.com/anika), the muse of the great [Geoff Barrow](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Barrow) ([Portishead](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portishead_(groupe))), discovered this cover of the [Chromatics](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatics). A track from an EP released in 2013 on [the Stones Throw](https://www.stonesthrow.com/) label, where the resulting rock sound is very well crafted, with an impression of detachment but yet so atypical !**"**

## Sea Moya - Nothing is real
_Anaïs G_: **"**Is it possible to bring together on the same EP different musical genres such as math rock, funk pop, electro or afrobeat ? Yes this is possible because the [Sea Moya](https://seamoya.bandcamp.com/) trio does it perfectly! A well dosed, well thought out and above all well produced mixture "Baltic States", released in 2016 is a musical jewel thackdrop of psychedelism!**"**

## Dope Lemon - Give Me Honey
_Anaïs G_: **"**To finish quietly while remaining in madness, there is nothing better than [Dope Lemon](https://www.dopelemon.com/), [Angus Stone's](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Stone) parallel project. I fall in love with the gentleman's offbeat universe and especially with this innate relaxation in the voice and in the music!**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. Thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Big thank you to [Alko B](https://www.facebook.com/Alkobmusic/) for his selection, and to [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/?hl=fr) for her great illustration.
