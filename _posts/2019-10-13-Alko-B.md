_Alko B_: **"**It’s a wonderful melody.. one of those where you say to yourself that you’d wish you had written.Santo and Johnny are a big inspiration to me, to my sound, this warmth they have created with they arrangements, the cranky lapsteel sound and the way it is performed is genius.**"**

## Los Indios Tabajaras – Maria Elena
_Alko B_: **"**I mean, try to wake up to this on a Sunday morning and you'll understand my choice.This is pure magic.**"**

## Duchess - Scott Walker
_Alko B_: **"**Paying tribute to this legend who passed away a few months ago. This song is a masterpiece. So many powerful emotions **"**
