<p id="introduction">This morning, nostalgia takes us, like a desire to go back, of lost softness, of odors disappeared .. But this morning I found the cure for the Sunday blues with the bad days fast approaching. Nothing like the music of Alko B to remedy all this.  
  
<br><br>             Subtle, calm and sensual, the music of this young musician andsinger from Beyrouth is a caress for difficult awakenings and rainydays. After being part of the band The Wanton Bishop andskimming the stages with them, after having had an electro-popproject called Loopstache, Alko B took the time to compose forhim to come up with a music that looks like him..<br><br>

# Alko B's selection

## Santo and Johnny – A Theme From A Summer Place
_Alko B_: **"**It’s a wonderful melody.. one of those where you say to yourself that you’d wish you had written.Santo and Johnny are a big inspiration to me, to my sound, this warmth they have created with they arrangements, the cranky lapsteel sound and the way it is performed is genius.**"**

## Los Indios Tabajaras – Maria Elena
_Alko B_: **"**I mean, try to wake up to this on a Sunday morning and you'll understand my choice.This is pure magic.**"**

## Duchess - Scott Walker
_Alko B_: **"**Paying tribute to this legend who passed away a few months ago. This song is a masterpiece. So many powerful emotions **"**
