With so much musicality, your Sunday starts off on the right foot.

# Glenn Astro's selection

## [Amaarae](https://soundcloud.com/amaarae) - SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY (feat. Moliy) 
Glenn Astro: **"**A dear friend of mine recommended to check out Amaarae’s album when it came out last year, since then I haven’t stopped listening to it. At least a few songs from that record daily. Weirdly, SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY has a very sunday’ish feel to me, works any other day as well, obviously. Amaarae’s voice is so hypnotizing and catching, on top of that the beats on that whole record are amazing, as well. **"**

## [Ross](https://www.discogs.com/fr/Ross-The-Pit-The-Pendulum/release/1808528) - Swallow your dreams 
Glenn Astro: **"**Found out about this one purely by accident while scrolling through my Instagram feed and this popped up in some random video, I instantly recognized the guitar riff that I knew from Blackalicious’ If I may but there were more instruments and parts coming in. 

I’ve listened to If I may, and Blackalicious in general, during my teenage years so much but never assumed that track in particular uses a sample, thought it was an original guitar riff they recorded for that track along with the singing in the chorus (pre internet and who sampled days haha). Anyhow, a few clicks and a discogs seller later, the record was on the way to my home. It’s strange how the original also has made me appreciate the If I may version even more. Well, here you go, two morning listening recommendations in one.**"**

## [Erika de Casier](https://erikadecasier.bandcamp.com/) - The Flow 
Glenn Astro: **"**I love the whole album. But what an opening song this is! Those wavey synth noise effects in the intro, followed up by ultra smooth percussions and pads. Everything is so minimal and sparse, vocal parts coming in and dropping out again...excellent. Essential Sunday morning listen, for sure.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Biensüre](https://www.facebook.com/biensurebiensure) - [Demme](https://soundcloud.com/biensurebiensure/demme)
ImaCrea: **"**Love Glenn Astro's latest album, [Homespun](https://glennastro.bandcamp.com/album/homespun), and especially this intriguing track. Feel like I'm in an old detective movie but with strange trippy moving textures in the background. Been years I've been following his work and it never disappoints.**"**

## [Luke Vibert](https://soundcloud.com/luke-vibert) - Batter Bits
ImaCrea: **"**Influence by the great bass developed in Glenn Astro's track, the name of Luke Vibert came to mind spontaneously. Another great artist always full of surprises and pushing his limits in every new release. What a pleasure to find this new track recently.**"**

## [Kelly Lee Owens](https://kellyleeowens.bandcamp.com) - My Own
ImaCrea: **"**Smooth and delicate track by Kelly for the tiring collective moment we're going through. A good reminder about the importance of caring for each other and oneself with deep sincerity. Thank you, Kelly.**"**

## [Khalab & M'berra Ensemble](https://djkhalab.bandcamp.com/album/mberra) - Skit Guit
ImaCrea: **"**World is vast, beautiful, and diverse. Who needs to go to Mars when such poetry surrounds us?**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Take great care, share the love. Much love to [Glenn Astro](https://glennastro.bandcamp.com)for his inspring Sunday selections and to Meriam Kherbat for her dear illustration!</p>
