<p id="introduction">This morning, some delicious morsels of sonic data have found their way to us, beamed directly from the mind of World Brain (or Lucas Ufo IRL). These nifty signals hold secrets to be unravelled, spilling all around us and across the sky of an animated reality in pastel-perfect colours.<br><br>

Almost edible and not quite imaginary, let’s stay by the stream of information awhile, sipping from big drinks of cosmic nostalgia and discreetly dancing to holographic sounds. In this temporary utopia, time is elastic and bodies etheric, an encyclopedic theatre of future memory inhabiting an unquantifiable aqueous plain.<br><br>

Artificial stars blink their sentience and fade at the flick of a switch. World Brain has more transmissions to make across these material plains. Do stay connected… the pleasure in sampling our universal state of digital becoming with you has been all ours.

# World Brain's selection

## Chaz Jenkel - I can get over it (if you can get over here)

World Brain: **"**I love this song, it makes me feel good. It's all about these three notes on the bass doing "pa pa pam"... Can you hear them? They make me shake my head.**"**


## Pilar Zeta - Clouds to Remember

World Brain: **"**Super beautiful evocative "ambient" track with a sweet title. I like instrumental songs with a good title, it's only a small hint to guide your stream of thoughts. Pilar Zeta is from Argentina and also makes beautiful visual art. She made all the crazy covers of Jimmy Edgar's label.**"**


## Syzygys - Fauna Grotesque

World Brain: **"**A band formed in the 80's by two Japanese women, playing organ and violin. This is a lovely "microtonal" tune. The instruments have a specific tuning, that's why it sounds a bit mysterious and "haunted". It makes me feel weird, but i like it :)**"**

# MailTape's selection

## World Brain - Hypertext
ImaCrea: **"**As I stumbled upon [World Brain's album](https://worldbrain.bandcamp.com/album/peer-2-peer) recently there was something instantly familiar with his sound. Un je ne sais quoi. I quickly entered in loop mode and for a couple of weeks, his mellow ethereal pop and sometime ironic and funny sound cheered me up with ease and lightness.

I finally remembered that he had a track selected by [Musique Chienne in episode 296](https://www.mailta.pe/296/musique-chienne/)... three years ago (!) What a delicious flashback.

I chose Hypertext for its super nostalgic feeling of freedom back to the beginnings of the internet. When making a random search on Altavista was all there was to do and it was damn fun and generous. In a way most of what could be found was there just for the sake of sharing knowledge or anything authentic without any hidden agenda.**"**

## Yves Tumor - Strawberry Privilege 
ImaCrea: **"**Big fan of Yves Tumor since their debut album. This track is from their [latest album](https://yves-tumor.bandcamp.com/album/heaven-to-a-tortured-mind) and it's an absolute gem of beauty. I feel like flying when listening to it.**"**

## Future Islands - Born in a War
ImaCrea: **"**Sam Sam Sam! Their could be corona out there but till Future Islands keep releasing new music, we're saved. This track encompass their unique sound without falling into a pale copy. It's hard to keep pushing after such a gem as "Seasons" and I find in this one new details I never heard before. A magnificient flow showing the full vitality of the band and how passionate they are about carving the future of pop music.**"**

## Wardown - Lorem Ipsum 
ImaCrea: **"**Like an old photograph found in a drawer years after. What have we done during all this time? Where are we going to? What if there was no answer? No direction? Breathe in... Breathe out. It's ok. Let the meditation takes you where it has to.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for this morning! Thanks for being with us. Drop us a poem or anything you'd like to share with us in comments, we'd appreciate it a lot. Much love to World Brain for his Sunday selection, to Daisy for her inspiring introduction and to Anthony for the stunning illustration. Peace.</p>
