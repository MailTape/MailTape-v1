# World Brain's selection

## Chaz Jenkel - I can get over it (if you can get over here)

World Brain: **"**I love this song, it makes me feel good. It's all about these three notes on the bass doing "pa pa pam"... Can you hear them? They make me shake my head.**"**


## Pilar Zeta - Clouds to Remember

World Brain: **"**Super beautiful evocative "ambient" track with a sweet title. I like instrumental songs with a good title, it's only a small hint to guide your stream of thoughts. Pilar Zeta is from Argentina and also makes beautiful visual art. She made all the crazy covers of Jimmy Edgar's label.**"**


## Syzygys - Fauna Grotesque

World Brain: **"**A band formed in the 80's by two Japanese women, playing organ and violin. This is a lovely "microtonal" tune. The instruments have a specific tuning, that's why it sounds a bit mysterious and "haunted". It makes me feel weird, but i like it :)**"**
