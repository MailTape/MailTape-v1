<p id="introduction"> This morning, we wanted to give you plenty to daydream about. What else are Sundays for? [Sorcha Richardson](https://sorcharichardson.bandcamp.com/album/first-prize-bravery) joins us with a varied and thoughtful selection to steady you for any kind of week that may lay ahead.

# Sorcha Richardson's selection

## [Pillow Queens](https://pillowqueens.bandcamp.com/album/in-waiting-2) - Liffey
Sorcha: **"**My favourite song from the wonderful debut album from Pillow Queens. It's full of intensity and emotion, and feels so rooted in Dublin. The whole song feels like it's balancing on a knife edge, ready to come crashing down at any moment, and somehow when the wave does crash it fades away like a gente lullaby. Those beautiful layered vocals at the end swim around my head for the rest of the day.**"**

## [Adrianne Lenker](https://adriannelenker.bandcamp.com/) - Anything
Sorcha: **"**I don't think I've ever heard an Adrianne Lenker song and not fallen in love with it. The guitars in this always make me think of sunlight reflecting on the water's surface of a lake. It's so calming and hypnotic and always ends too soon.**"** 

## [Q](https://soundcloud.com/boymeetseuphoria) - Take Me Where Your Heart Is
Sorcha: **"**I just heard this today and have listened 4 times already. I'll probably go and learn it on guitar tomorrow. I love the simplicity and restraint and the repetitive nature of it all. A song that fits almost any mood.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Sorcha Richardson](https://sorcharichardson.bandcamp.com/) - Twisting The Knife
Sarah: **"**I love the fluttering of piano that tiptoes through this track, stepping in and out of the grounding guitar line. Sorcha's songwriting always strikes me; she dissects the ties between us with tremendous attention and care. I still think of kerosene arrows:) She describes her world with brutal tenderness, in this track and all through her debut album, [First Prize Bravery](https://sorcharichardson.bandcamp.com/album/first-prize-bravery).**"**

## [Porridge Radio](https://porridgeradio.bandcamp.com/) - 7 Seconds
Sarah: **"**Porridge Radio's album [Every Bad](https://porridgeradio.bandcamp.com/album/every-bad) got me through the year. This stands out as a more gentle release in comparison to the ablum's tracks [Sweet](https://porridgeradio.bandcamp.com/album/every-bad), [Circling](https://porridgeradio.bandcamp.com/album/every-bad), and [Give/Take](https://porridgeradio.bandcamp.com/album/every-bad) (which I recommend checking out as well ;)). 7 Seconds is rough and and strong and delicate all at the same time, a hypnotic mesh of hard-hitting lyrics, heavy guitar backups, and 80's synths. The punk rock clashing with sweet 80's pop is so captivating :) hope you like the energy as much as I did.**"**

## [Molly Parden](https://mildlife.com.au) - These Are The Times
Sarah: **"**A good friend played this in the car and I listened to it for days afterward. Maybe you will, too :) Love the brass breakdown towards the end guided by Molly Parden's aerial vocals, something to dream about :)**"**

## [Michael Nau](https://www.michaelnau.com/) - Rides Through The Morning
Sarah: **"**I wish my whole day could be backed up by the drumline and folk chorus in this track. There's something so rumbling and yet dreamy about these progressions, it feels timeless.**"**

<p id="outroduction"> T.S. Eliot said he measured his life out in coffee spoons, I imagine I measure mine in MailTape episodes. Thank you for listening with us and taking some of your Sunday morning moments to daydream :) Thank you to [Sorcha](https://sorcharichardson.bandcamp.com/album/first-prize-bravery) for joining us with this selection and thank you to [Jason](https://www.instagram.com/grancharismo/?hl=en) for this gorgeous illustration!
