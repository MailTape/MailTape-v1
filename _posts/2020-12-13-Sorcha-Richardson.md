<p id="introduction"> Do you feel that this Sunday, winter is approaching so strongly that we must now wear an extra layer of clothes? We do too. To avoid sinking into the gray, we invited [MPL [Ma Pauvre Lucette]](https://www.mplofficiel.fr/) to add a more harmonious, more colorful layer, softer to the ears than the sound of wood breaking due to the cold, warmer than the anonymity of swaddled faces.
  <br><br>
  Then, we must know how to let the music speak for itself and step aside, to contemplate. Atypical voices, slow constructions, all the luxuriousness of a world which, as winter allows it, seems to take a break to regenerate and mutate for the better.

# Sorcha Richardson's selection

## [Pillow Queens](https://soundcloud.com/clarayse) - Liffey
Sorcha: **"**My favourite song from the wonderful debut album from Pillow Queens. It's full of intensity and emotion, and feels so rooted in Dublin. The whole song feels like it's balancing on a knife edge, ready to come crashing down at any moment, and somehow when the wave does crash it fades away like a gente lullaby. Those beautiful layered vocals at the end swim around my head for the rest of the day.**"**

## [Adrianne Lenker](https://philemoncimon.bandcamp.com) - Anything
Sorcha: **"**I don't think I've ever heard an Adrianne Lenker song and not fallen in love with it. The guitars in this always make me think of sunlight reflecting on the water's surface of a lake. It's so calming and hypnotic and always ends too soon.**"** 

## [Q](https://thousand1000.bandcamp.com) - Take Me Where Your Heart Is
Sorcha: **"**I just heard this today and have listened 4 times already. I'll probably go and learn it on guitar tomorrow. I love the simplicity and restraint and the repetitive nature of it all. A song that fits almost any mood.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [MPL](https://www.mplofficiel.fr) - Wagon-Wagon
Sarah: **"**From the first notes and this fabulous chorus, it's a journey beginning. And then this song becomes your partner of a moment that leaves you like a accompanied child in transit in an airport, lost and ready to reach out to anyone. On Sundays, when it seems that you have in front of you both too much time, and at the same time not enough before the sun sets again, it is this kind of love story that takes you on board and declare “may the day not be the one you will regret not having spent.**"**

## [Arthur H](https://www.arthur-h.net) - Paris la Silencieuse
Sarah: **"**Used to taking trains, used to continuing the journey of the TGV that arrived at Paris Gare de Lyon with music to slip into the arms of a tumultuous city. The perfect sequel to Wagon Wagon is played with Arthur H. A guru at the same level than MPL’s Arthur.**"**

## [Mildlife](https://mildlife.com.au) - How Long Does It Take
Sarah: **"**This is a big allegory of a post-MPL listening, but without the lyrics. Go through such different layers, from a sweet melancholy towards a desire to clap foots and head that sets in without you realizing it to end with an inexorable desire to run in the street with your mouth open, catching flies and not regret it.**"**

## [MPL](https://www.mplofficiel.fr) - M-A espace M-I-E
Sarah: **"**End with all the beauty of MPL, of the words, of the flow which has the leisure to put vocoder in while the prior talent does not require the slightest pinch. Once the song is over, everything will indeed go M-I-E /better/ during the day.**"**

<p id="outroduction">Beauty has to stop, sorry! Hope you’ve enjoyed it, as to see this day as new, bright and shiny one. Thank you to MPL [Ma Pauvre Lucette] for this selection full of sensibility and yet, a perfect mirror of Sundays as protected into some chaotic outer world. Thank you to [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr) for his great and colored interpretation from a neon-sourced picture of [Xavier Lours](http://xavierlours.fr).

  Listen to silence before it burns out.</p>
