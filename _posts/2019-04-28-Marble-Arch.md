<p id="introduction"> This morning, we are giving way to a wave of ambient melancholy, soft and light. As time playing on roller coasters , [Marble Arch’s](https://marblearch.bandcamp.com/) pop accompanies us this morning in this musical fog with many facets.
<br><br>
[Marble Arch](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Arch) is a white marble monument of Carrara near Speakers' Corner to the northeast of Hyde Park, at the west end of Oxford Street in London, UK. But it is also and especially a young group of French shoegaze. Their second album ["Children of the Slump"](https://soundcloud.com/geographierecs/sets/marble-arch-children-of-the-1) was released on March 22 on [Geography Records](https://soundcloud.com/geographierecs)/[Echo Orange](https://soundcloud.com/echoorangerecords).

# Marble Arch's selection

## [Deerhunter](https://soundcloud.com/deerhunterofficial) - Helicopter
_Marble Arch_: **"**Very atmospheric track, it's pure Bradford Cox, it could be taken from Atlas sound's LP "let the blind lead those who can see but can not feel" finally.
It is a slow song, quiet, bright ... Simply verses with chorus that always give me chills.It's powerful but delicate with a crescendo end and especially this snare details at 3:42, genius ...**"**

## [Muddy Monk](https://soundcloud.com/muddymonk) - Si l'on ride
_Marble Arch_: **"**I love this song, and all the songs of [Muddy Monk](https://muddy-monk.bandcamp.com/)to be honest.
I think we must have the same influences. Every time I see a new MM's track, I'm sure that I will love it. Atmospheric synth (as usual I love that ;-)) heady notes, bass line ... Perfect to get up at dawn, when everything is still sleeping.**"**

## [Simply Red](http://www.simplyred.com/) - Holding back the years
_Marble Arch_: **"**This is my guilty pleasure, I love this song so much. My father used to listen to it a lot, it brings me back. It seems to me that this is the theme of this song.It's super sweet, melancholy, nostalgic but it puts me in a good mood!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Marble Arch](https://www.facebook.com/marblearchmusic/) - Moonstruck 
_Anaïs G_: **"**At [Marble Arch](https://soundcloud.com/marblearchband), I love everything! Its vaporous universe, its freshness, their labels where they are signed. I can only tell you even more when I listen to "Moonstruck" which is my favorite of his latest album. A musical flight to infinity! **"**

## [BadBadNotGood](http://badbadnotgood.com/) - Time Moves Slow feat Sam Herring
_Anaïs G_: **"**As we repeat [Sam Herring’s](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Herring) crooner voice, "Time Moves Slow"... This sums up my state of mind this Sunday morning. A mix of jazz, hip-hop and soul, only Badbadnotgood can do it. And even 4 years after its release, this song did not take a wrinkle and is one of the classics to have in its player.**"**

## [Lenny Pistol](https://www.facebook.com/LennyPistol/) - Ashamed
_Anaïs G_: **"**Little new signed by Luik Records, his off-beat and gliding side makes him an indispensable element in this playist."Pistil Boy" is the name of his first album released last February where figure "Ashamed". We say thank you Belgium! **"**

## [Bauhaus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus) - Bela Lugosi's Dead 
_Anaïs G_: **"**A special atmosphere that creates a special ending. 9 min of rock from the 80’s, of tension palpable felt by the guitar chords. Something heavy but hovering at the end. **"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening. Much respect to Marble Arch for his Sunday selections today, and to Camille Célestin for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
