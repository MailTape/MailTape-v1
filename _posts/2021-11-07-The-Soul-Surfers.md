# The Soul Surfers' selection

## [François de Roubaix](https://www.discogs.com/artist/119363-Fran%C3%A7ois-De-Roubaix) - Poursuite Sur Les Dunes d'Ostende
The Soul Surfers: **"**One of my favorite french composer, with his own univers and such an explorer of new sounds (one of the first to used synthesizer in soundtracks in France). He died too young, but made some crazy album mostly for movies and documentary.**"**

## [Stringtronics](https://www.macleans.ca/culture/the-weird-and-true-story-of-moondog/) - Dawn Mists
The Soul Surfers: **"**Taken from the legendary album [Mindbender](https://lightintheattic.net/releases/517-mindbender), this is one of the finest library music record ever made and one of the hardest to find in original pressing!**"**

## [Whitefield Brothers](https://www.zappa.com/) feat Bajka - Joyful Exaltation
The Soul Surfers: **"**I had the chance to work with JJ Whitefield (Whitefield Brothers, Poets of Rhythm, Karl Hector). He's an amazing musician and crate digger, back in the 1990's he was one of the pionneers in the revival of funk.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Janko Nilovic and The Soul Surfers](https://brocrecordz.bandcamp.com/album/maze-of-sounds) - Maze of Sounds Alternate Take
Sarah: **"**loved the entire Maze of Sounds album, and this unreleaseed track of the album's namesake struck me as particularly interesting. the organ and bass lines are perfectly intertwined, moving at once together and side by side. **"**

## [The Soul Surfers](https://soulsurfersubiq.bandcamp.com/), [Shawn Lee](https://www.shawnlee.net/) - Time is a Gun
Sarah: **"**Great collaboration with Shawn Lee, released in 2015. Love the vocals on this :) again, the organ carries this song to new heights. Listen for the percussive break toward the end, one that takes us right into guitar improvisation that sways between streams of organ chords.**"**

## [The Natural Yogurt Band](https://thenaturalyogurtband.bandcamp.com/) - 57 Lashes of the Mallet
Sarah: **"**One of two songs on the september 2021 release, 57 Lashes of the Mallet. Was pleasantly surprised with the flute overtakings, complemented so well by the treading basslines. The introduction of the cello toward the end!! The Natural Yogurt Band, headed by bassist Wayne Fullwood and multi-instrumentalist Miles Newbold, takes great influence from the 1970's library music movement, adding accents of electronic and classical music.**"**

## [Africa Express](https://africaexpress.bandcamp.com/album/egoli) feat [Moonchild Sanelly](https://www.dazeddigital.com/projects/article/52989/1/moonchild-sanelly-musician-biography-dazed-100-2021-profile), [Mahotella Queens](https://www.discogs.com/artist/56676-Mahotella-Queens), [Muzi](https://www.thefader.com/2021/10/01/muzi-new-album-interblaktic-stream), [Mr Jukes](https://www.facebook.com/muziou) - Morals
Sarah: **"**Africa Express is renown for making diverse collaborations like this possible. This track arrives off of the 2019 album, Egoli.**"**
