Daniel Rossen - Saint Nothing
Daniel Rossen is part of the band Grizzly Bear and many people aren't aware of his great solo project.
This particular song has a beautiful melody and harmonies between his voice, the piano and the arrangements.
Perfect music for a sunday morning.

Joni Mitchell - I Don't Know where I stand
This song is part of Joni's second studio album: Clouds. It's a folk album, but it's so much more, it's weird. The harmonies are strange and mysterious and completely post-genre (example of this in minute 2:50 of the song).
She produced most of the album herself and painted the artwork (she's an incredible visual artist too).

Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood - Some Velvet Morning
This song is mindblowing. It's basically two completely different songs with different tempos in one, and they switch from one to another like it's no big deal. Amazing.
