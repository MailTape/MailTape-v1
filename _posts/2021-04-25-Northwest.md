<p id="introduction">
  This morning,
   <br><br> 
</p>

# Northwest's selection

## Daniel Rossen - Saint Nothing
Northwest: **"**Daniel Rossen is part of the band Grizzly Bear and many people aren't aware of his great solo project.This particular song has a beautiful melody and harmonies between his voice, the piano and the arrangements.
Perfect music for a sunday morning. **"**

## Joni Mitchell - I Don't Know where I stand
Northwest: **"**This song is part of Joni's second studio album: Clouds. It's a folk album, but it's so much more, it's weird. The harmonies are strange and mysterious and completely post-genre (example of this in minute 2:50 of the song).She produced most of the album herself and painted the artwork (she's an incredible visual artist too). **"**

## Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood - Some Velvet Morning
Northwest: **"**This song is mindblowing. It's basically two completely different songs with different tempos in one, and they switch from one to another like it's no big deal. Amazing.**"**
