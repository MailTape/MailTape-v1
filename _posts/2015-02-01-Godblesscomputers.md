# Godblesscomputers' morning inspiration
<br>

## Ifan Dafydd - Celwydd (feat. Alys Williams)
_Godblesscomputers:_ **"**Ifan Dafydd is one of my favorite producers. I love is way to make beats with deep piano chords and glitch sounds. I also appreciate his way to use vocals as an instrument.**"**
 
## Guerre - For Qwanisha
_Godblesscomputers:_ **"**I don't have many infos about Guerre. I found his stuff some month ago on Bandcamp and I felt in love with his music. He reminds me some James Blake tunes with more glitchy sounds.**"**
 
## Long Arm - When Children Sleep
_Godblesscomputers:_ **"**I love jazz. And I found really interesting when someone is able to find a good balance between samples and electronic sounds.**"**
