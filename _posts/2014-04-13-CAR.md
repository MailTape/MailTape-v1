<p id="introduction">
This morning, dive into the atmosphere of the upcoming [29th International Festival of Fashion and Photography at Hyeres](http://www.villanoailles-hyeres.com/hyeres2014/ "More infos"). [C.A.R](http://www.c-a-r-music.com "Her website"), who will be playing there, made us the pleasure to join us this morning. Her poetry and captivating style distilled this selection into a mesmerizing eclectic patchwork.</p>

# Clair obscur

First band I thought about when I listened to “Spitfire” was The Cure. Rare are the artists who are able to mix together darkness and lightness with such easyness. Something that might be the result of her poetic and ecstatic energy. Creator of [C.A.R](http://www.c-a-r-music.com "Her website"), Chloé Raunet, is also known for being the singer of the former London coldwave band Battant, she supported Gesaffelstein on his European tour and also opened for Cat Power at the Paris Olympia. 

# Her morning inspiration

## TY - Hamfarahali
C.A.R: **"**Thor, my partner in crime for the live introduced me to these Icelandic reprobates. I don't understand the lyrics but he assures me they're cool as. It does sound that way, doesn't it?**"**

## Golden Teacher - Like a Hawk
C.A.R: **"**Everyone should be excited about Golden Teacher. Live, they're one of the best acts you're likely to see & their releases on Optimo Music just get better and better. 'Like A Hawk' is a latete atoto classic. We play it all the time and I can't get enough of it.**"**

## Seftel - Spanish Song
C.A.R: **"**I've never met Larry Seftel but he lives in my neighbourhood, sings a bit off and makes simple music full of imperfections.
This song came out last year & has Spain in the title but right now, it makes me wanna sit on my roof with a glass of wine, watching the sun set in a Hackney haze.**"**
