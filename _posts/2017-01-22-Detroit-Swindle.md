# **Detroit Swindle’s selection**

+ ## A Tribe Called Quest - Whateva Will Be
_Maarten of Detroit Swindle_: **"**The new tribe album was probably the most anticipated hip hop album of the year, and it turned out great. There’s a couple of really cool tracks, and a great balance between classic Tribe, and new influences. “Whateva” is one of those classic tracks. Great drum production by Q-tip, and really clever and original sample use. It’s not the first track I’d put on when I wake up, but when I’m finally up and running and have had breakfast with my wife and the kids, this one will go nicely with a cup of coffee as a boost of energy and overall bringer of good vibes.**"**

+ ## Anderson .Paak - The Bird
_Maarten of Detroit Swindle_: **"**This one is the first track on his new album, and puts me in such a nice mood. I can almost smell the sea and see a slow sunrise in L.A., people getting into the water for a morning surf session and an overall vibe of tranquility. In our busy-as-hell life, it’s music like this that really makes you unwind and just lets you ‘be’ for a bit.**"**

+ ## Bj The Chicago Kid - Turning Me Up
_Maarten of Detroit Swindle_: **"**I haven’t heard his debut album, but this one is great. A great soulful listen with lots of resemblance to D’Angelo, Raphael Saadiq and his buddy Anderson, but with his own kind of funk. This track especially has a really great vibe with the live instrumentation and horns. Feelgood stuff if you’re having trouble getting started or just wanna have an “all day pyjamas day”.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Detroit Swindle – You, Me, Here, Now
_Laura_: **"**Completely soulful with the right amount of deep house rhythm plus a splendid crescendo that will blow your mind. I would be surprised if you don’t listen to this song twice in a row. Push the volume up folks, it’s time to wake up and burst with energy!**"**

+ ## Session Victim – Hey Stranger
_Laura_: **"**A softly joyful track with a shiny ritournelle and a frenetic riff that will get you hooked. Session Victim is a German duo of DJs that loves to overstep the boundaries of music genres, which they’re doing perfectly with this ideal blend of Soul, Funk and Electronic music.**"**


+ ## Mocky – Soulful Beat
_Laura_: **"**Mocky comes from Canada and travelled to the electronic scenes of Berlin and L.A., working with famous international artists and later falling in love with jazz. Incredibly blissful, soulful, jazzy, this electro-pop song will make you want to lie down in the grass on a Spring afternoon.**"**

+ ## The Bamboos – Get in the Scene
_Laura_: **"**Considered by many as the Australian masters of Funk, the Bamboos are getting us on our feet for a morning swing with this splendid fusion of Jazz, Funk and Hip-Hop.**"**
