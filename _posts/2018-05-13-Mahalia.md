  This morning feels like it’s okay to be seventeen again. Lay around in bed all
  day. Texting and smiling, liking and giggling. Today’s MailTape is an odd to
  the importance of accepting yourself, just as you are, with all your flaws and
  insecurities. From your most adorable moments to the hottest of your desires.
  Give yourself permission to be the highest of the high to the darkest of the
  dark. It’s all good because it’s all equal.

<p id="introduction">This morning feels like it’s okay to be seventeen again. Lay around in bed all day. Texting and smiling, liking and giggling. Today’s MailTape is an ode to the importance of accepting yourself, just as you are, with all your flaws and insecurities. From your most adorable moments to the hottest of your desires. Give yourself permission to be the highest of the high to the darkest of the dark. It’s all good because it’s all equal.</p>
<p>As our guest [Mahalia](https://www.facebook.com/mahaliamusic/) reminds us today, we must take pride in being ourselves. Just let yourself be and allow yourself to be free. You can smile on random occasions, take a late night bike ride or even gaze at the sky until the sun decides to rise. Being free isn’t about impressing anyone, it isn’t about looking your best, or working the hardest. It isn’t about that perfect hair day or that extra money in your bank account. It’s about letting go, letting the life flow through your veins and loving each breath like it is a magical gift you were given to enjoy and give great honor to. Don’t stress, just be yourself.</p>


# Mahalia's selection


## Maxwell — Ascension
_Mahalia_: **"**It was a song that I used to hear in the house when I was younger. I think my parents used to play it. I found it on Spotify recently and thought : « Oh my god, I know this song! ». I just remember being a kid, running around, singing it with my parents. So I think I listen to that a lot because it’s kind of nostalgic.**"**

## Russ — Scared
_Mahalia_: **"**Russ is an artist from the US, I really love. He pulled out an album last year and I hadn’t heard that one song. It’s just one of my favorites right now, so I just say to everyone to listen to it. It’s really beautiful.**"**

## Bakar — All in
_Mahalia_: **"**Bakar has got a British accent and this song is kind of fun. It has fun lyrics and it feels really happy. For me, at the moment, I feel like a lot of music isn’t really hitting that spot. A lot a music is kind of moody, I can sing to it or dance to it, but nothing is giving me that genuine happiness that I used to get from music when I was a kid.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Mahalia — 17
_Louise_: **"**Mahalia has this crazy charm. _17_ comes from her EP _Diary of Me_. It's not the latest song she has released, but I love what she's saying in this track. Accepting yourself, being a black woman in a small town of England. It's a strong statement and I feel like it can help many kids accepting themselves.**"**

## Raveena — I Won't Mind
_Louise_: **"**Raveena's silky voice soothes my soul. This track is pure honey. The harp and mellow piano are perfect for a chill Sunday morning and staying in bed.**"**

## Isatta Sheriff — Moving On
_Louise_: **"**I needed another hip-hop groove in this tape. Here's Isatta Sheriff, she's a rapper and teacher in London. I love her flow and we definitely need more women rappers like her!**"**

## okaywill — Love will find a way
_Louise_: **"**The power of MailTape is searching new music for hours on Soundcloud and finding a track that was missing in your life. For me, this time, it was okaywill.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks!
