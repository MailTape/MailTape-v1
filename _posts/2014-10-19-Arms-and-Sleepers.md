# Here you write an attractive and engaging title

And here you speak a bit about the artist and let the inspiration flow :)

# Arms and Sleepers' morning inspiration
 
## Andrew Bird - Near Death Experience Experience
_Arms and Sleepers:_ **"**Absolutely love this song - stellar instrumentation and the perfect Sunday morning wake-up call. I spent a couple of days in Istanbul this summer for the Arms and Sleepers show there, and a friend I was staying with played this track on a lovely Sunday morning with the frenetic sounds of the city coming in through the window. It was the perfect tranquilizer to the city's hectic (but energizing) lifestyle.**"**
 
## Philip Selway - By Some Miracle
_Arms and Sleepers:_ **"**I first heard this song through the music video directed by the super talented David Altobelli.  After falling in love with the video, I fell in love with the song.  Its moody atmosphere, beautiful melodies, and lazy pace are just the right stuff for my Sunday mornings.**"**
 
## Clark - Unfurla
_Arms and Sleepers:_ **"**This is a new song, but I've been listening to it a lot ever since its release (so maybe not just on Sunday mornings). This tune really gets me going as I'm starting a new day - great, great energy.**"**
