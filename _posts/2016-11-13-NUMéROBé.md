<p id="introduction">This morning let the subtlety of this selection pinch you out of numbness. Our guest NUMéRObé has gathered a few tunes to wiggle your spine to. Some artists are there to make you forget while others bring you forward, spinning on a carousel, doubting your fulcrums. This French artist's music is reminiscent of a projection of lights, circulating around your shadows, reconnection the dots and without paying much attention, you'll come closer to stillness and enjoy the neutrality.
