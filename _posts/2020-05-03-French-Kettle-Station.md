# French Kettle Station's selection

## [Orior](https://soundcloud.com/orior-music) - Feels Like Summer
French Kettle Station: **"**Sundays in Denver typically feature a lack of commotion & hustle. The pace makes it much easier for me to focus, reflect and heal. I wanted the atmosphere of my selections to mirror the insular fondness I have tied to these activities. Jeff Sharp's "Orior" has an extreme quality of mystery & isolation, yet somehow maintains optimism. "Feels Like Summer" blends the organic and the digital in a truly awe-inspiring way. I can never get enough of this one.**"**

## [Zazou / Bikaye / CY1](https://zazoubikaye.bandcamp.com/album/noir-et-blanc) - Mangungu
French Kettle Station: **"**Zazou / Bikaye / CY1 sees the collaboration between a Congolese percussionist, a French composer and two modular synthesists. "Mangungu" plays with stark contrasts as well (made clear by the album title "Noir Et Blanc") and has an an unbelievably rare feel to it with 6/8 time, foreboding harmonies, percussive synths and flanged-out vocals. You can tell they knew exactly what they wanted to achieve on this track and nailed it. Musical moments as realized as this make life worth living.**"**

## [Colleen](https://colleencolleen.bandcamp.com/album/captain-of-none) - This Hammer Breaks
French Kettle Station: **"**I have loved Cécile Schott since I first heard "The Golden Morning Breaks" 10 years ago. Her earlier works were emotive instrumental works, and when she began incorporating her voice it really became something special. "This Hammer Breaks" goes so many incredible places with just voice, drums and minimal electronics. It makes me feel like I am sailing alone in the dark, venturing toward something unknown at a speed I have no control over (which is essentially how I feel just being alive).**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Quiet Dawn](https://www.facebook.com/QuietDawn) - Being
Anaïs G: **"**Very different from these last EPs, this one deals with human behaviours: sadness, love, anger, sex, friendship... What I like the most in "Human Being - The Short Story Of The Reed" is its ultra jazzy-groovy, almost instrumental side. A delight for the ears!**"**

## [Tigran Hamasyan](https://tigranhamasyan.bandcamp.com/) - Vardavar
Anaïs G: **"**It was in the course of a conversation with a friend that I discovered this armenian jazz pianist. It was this song that made me want to listen to more of his songs. An explosion of the senses, a patchwork of a thousand colours, that's how I could describe his music! Several facets that I can't wait to discover through these different albums...**"**

## [Swarvy](https://soundcloud.com/swarvy) - Spam Grease (Feat Kiefer Schakelford)
Anaïs G: **"**It was while re-listening to [Kiefer](https://soundcloud.com/kiefdaddy)'s songs that I came across this artist, producer and multi-instrumentalist, Swarvy. His album "Elderberry", released on the [Leaving Records](https://leavingrecords.com/) label, is a jazzy-soul nugget that smoothes you instantly.**"**

## [Hania Rani](https://soundcloud.com/haniarani-music) - Sun 
Anaïs G: **"**Who says you need lyrics to make a song better? Hania Rani is proof of that. This pianist, composer and musician has touched me in the depths of my soul with her music that has no borders and no colour. Each note is an emotion, it's beautiful and sublime!**"**
