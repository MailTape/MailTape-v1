<p id="introduction">This morning,</p>


# Maud Geffray's selection

## Alessandro Cortini — Scappa
_Maud Geffray_: **"**I love that guy, Alessandro was the keyboard of NIN during a few years, what he does under his own name is incredible. He’s based in LA and is one of the best musician from this modular synth scene. Just perfect for a sunday morning.**"**

## Lana Del Rey - Love
_Maud Geffray_: **"**Tragic romance, some of my friends wouldn’t share my pleasure, but that’s a real personal one.**"**

## Casual Gabberz — Inutile de fuir - la compilation
_Maud Geffray_: **"**Crescendo. The Casual Gabberz compilation is perfect to give me power for the rest of the day.**"**
