<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome the amazing producer [Maud Geffray](https://www.facebook.com/maudgeffray75/) on MailTape. Her [solo album 'POLAAR'](https://paneuropeanrecording.bandcamp.com/album/polaar) is a multi-layered gem of cold electronic music. Today’s episode is a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings melted in electronic sounds. I hope you're ready for the ride! I’m really proud of this episode, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.</p>

# Maud Geffray's selection

## Alessandro Cortini — Scappa
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**I love that guy, Alessandro was the keyboard of NIN during a few years, what he does under his own name is incredible. He’s based in L.A. and is one of the best musician from this modular synth scene. Just perfect for a sunday morning.**"**

## Lana Del Rey - Love
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**Tragic romance, some of my friends wouldn’t share my pleasure, but that’s a real personal one.**"**

## Casual Gabberz — Inutile de fuir (la compilation)
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**Crescendo. [Casual Gabberz's compilation](https://soundcloud.com/casualgabberz/sets/inutile-de-fuir-casual-gabberz-va) is perfect to give me power for the rest of the day.**"**

_Louise_ :  **"**The compilation is made of 51 banger tracks, I couldn't fit them all in this tape, so Maud chose the track **Lycamobile by Paul Seul**. If you liked this track, please go check out [the whole tape](https://soundcloud.com/casualgabberz/sets/inutile-de-fuir-casual-gabberz-va)!**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Maud Geffray — Polaar
_Louise_ : **"**This is the opening track from Maud Geffray's debut album. With this song I feel like I can achieve anything. There’s something very cinematic in it, just as the rest of the LP. It blows me away to another world.**"**

## Helena Hauff — Gift
_Louise_ : **"**This Helena Hauff track is perfect to start the day! Some good synths and rhythm to kick your butt and boost your energy. It builds up in an amazing way!**"**

## Gang Sign — Prequel
_Louise_ : **"**As always when working on MailTape, I’ve been lost in Soundcloud. This track appears as if it’s gonna be a pop song at the beginning… but there’s this fast synth that comes in and turns it into something more electronic. I love how this track evolves in a way I didn’t see coming.**"**

## Hiroshi Yoshimura (吉村弘) — Dance PM
_Louise_ : **"**I felt like I had to have something really smooth to close this tape. I was amazed when I found this Japanese 80’s song from Hiroshi Yoshimura. I couldn’t find a better track to end this tape. Ambient at its best!**"**
