<p id="introduction">By way of Sweden and Eritrea we welcome London-based singer/songwriter, [Miryam Solomon](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/), who joins us to provide an eclectic Sunday morning playlist that promises, with any luck, to accompany our sapling-like emergence from the extended winter.</p>
<p>Merging folk textures with jazz melodies, Miryam followed her debut 2014 EP, [Evergreen](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/evergreen), with her second EP, [Magnolia](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/magnolia), last year. Inspired by feminist psychoanalysis, vocal improvisation, Ghanaian high life and dreams of Scandinavia, Miryam's music is also conjugated by  polyrhythms from drummer Seb Rochford. Shabaka Hutchings on clarinet, bassist Jean Berthon and drummer Tansay Omar also feature.</p>


# Miryam Solomon's selection


## Grand Puba – I Like It
_Miryam Solomon_: **"**I never tire of this—it’s such a jam and a gem. Grand Puba is such a witty and humorous lyricist made even better with his signature melodic flow. I love how this is both an ode to 90’s NY hiphop and an homage to Soul and Jazz with the Jackson Five, The Stylistics, Rose Royce and Al Jarreu references. The video and album was also a nod to the future and probably one of the first videos I can remember that explored the millennium theme. **"**

## The Invisible – Life's Dancers (Floating Points Remix)
_Miryam Solomon_: **"**It's so beautiful and life affirming. The words feel like a meditation in its repetition, powerful and heartfelt and the string arrangement is gorgeous. It makes me want dance every time without fail, so infectious and playful.
**"**

## Chassol – Dominos Part III
_Miryam Solomon_: **"**I’m a bit obsessed with this track—the conch, percussion, beautiful chords and harmonies. It’s an absolute joy to listen to.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Miryam Solomon – Something About Your Mother
_Sanjay_: **"**Easy and unhurried, this downtempo track from Miryam's latest EP, [Magnolia](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/magnolia), feels like the perfect accompaniment to Sunday morning for me.**"**

## Alfa Mist – Nucleus
_Sanjay_: **"**This five-piece band united by [Alfa](https://alfamist.bandcamp.com/) on keys are making some beautifully harmonious and melancholic music right now. This makes me want to stay wrapped inside my warm duvet on a Sunday morning...**"**

## Mélissa Laveaux – Lè Ma Monte Chwal Mwen
_Sanjay_: **"**The title of this song means 'when I’m riding my horse' in Haitian Creole, and there's a suitably bright sway to it. [Mélissa](https://www.facebook.com/melissalaveauxoff) takes traditional tunes, vodou anthems and scraps and phrases discovered in old songbooks, and sews them together like a patchwork of intersecting lives.**"**

## Kokoroko – Abusey Junction
_Sanjay_: **"**Meaning 'be strong' in Urhobo, [Kokoroko](https://www.facebook.com/kokorokomusic/) return with this contribution to Brownswood Recording's recent compilation, [We Out Here](https://weouthere.bandcamp.com/album/we-out-here). A beautifully melodic track to listen to whilst your morning coffee percolates, opening with lightly picked guitars and somber percussion.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Miryam Solomon](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
