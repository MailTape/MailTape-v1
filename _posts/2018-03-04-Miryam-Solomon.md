<p id="introduction">By way of Sweden and Eritrea we welcome London-based singer/songwriter, [Miryam Solomon](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/), who joins us to provide an eclectic Sunday morning playlist that will hopefully accompany the arrival of spring...</p>
<p>Merging folk textures with jazz melodies, Miryam followed her debut 2014 EP, [Evergreen](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/evergreen), with her second EP, [Magnolia](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/magnolia), last year. Inspired by feminist psychoanalysis, vocal improvisation, Ghanaian high life and dreams of Scandinavia, Miryam's music is also conjugated by  polyrhythms from drummer Seb Rochford. Shabaka Hutchings on clarinet, bassist Jean Berthon and drummer Tansay Omar also feature.</p>


# Miryam Solomon's selection


## Grand Puba – I Like It
_Miryam Solomon_: **"**I never tire of this—it’s such a jam and a gem. Grand Puba is such a witty and humorous lyricist made even better with his signature melodic flow. I love how this is both an ode to 90’s NY hiphop and an homage to Soul and Jazz with the Jackson Five, The Stylistics, Rose Royce and Al Jarreu references. The video and album was also a nod to the future and probably one of the first videos I can remember that explored the millennium theme. **"**

## The Invisible – Life's Dancers (Floating Points Remix)
_Miryam Solomon_: **"**It's so beautiful and life affirming. The words feel like a meditation in its repetition, powerful and heartfelt and the string arrangement is gorgeous. It makes me want dance every time without fail, so infectious and playful.
**"**

## Chassol – Dominos Part III
_Miryam Solomon_: **"**I’m a bit obsessed with this track—the conch, percussion, beautiful chords and harmonies. It’s an absolute joy to listen to.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Miryam Solomon – Something About Your Mother
_Sanjay_: **"**A beautiful piece which blends undulating narratives about exile, hope and love alongside punchy rhythmic lines and improvisation.**"**

## Alfa Mist – Nucleus
_Sanjay_: **"**Sung in a low and affecting vibrato [Cécile](http://www.cecilemclorinsalvant.com/) has set Haitian poet [Ida Faubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Faubert)'s 1930s poem, 'Le Front Caché Sur Tes Genoux', to a wonderfully languid 6/8 time. I could listen to it all day!**"**

## Mélissa Laveaux – Lè Ma Monte Chwal Mwen
_Sanjay_: **"**[Jazzmeia Horn](https://www.theartistryofjazzhorn.com/) sings and scats through diverse moods, styles and tempos, with inherent ease. Her debut album, 'A Social Call', is full of confidence that she conveys throughout her music.**"**

## Kokoroko – Abusey Junction
_Sanjay_: **"**A relative oldie but a goodie! Taken from [Zara McFarlane](https://www.zaramcfarlane.com/)'s 2011 album, 'Until Tomorrow', this track embraces a suitably noir-ish and smokey after hours vibe adorned with a blazing saxophone solo.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Miryam Solomon](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
