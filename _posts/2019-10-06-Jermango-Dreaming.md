<p id="introduction">This morning, Jermango Dreaming is our guest for this episode.
<br><br>
Mainly featuring an old Swedish upright piano as its sole instrument, Shida Shahabi's debut album—Homes—released almost a year ago delves deep into explorations of intimate piano tones. Living comfortably with traces of wear and decay its production eschews the prioritising of fussy cleanliness. A warm and fuzzy noise floor audible from the very first track immediately immerses the listener into this quieter brand of assurance and imperfection—as though the whole existed beneath a layer of dust.
<br><br>
Her second LP, [Shifts](https://shida-shahabi.bandcamp.com/album/shifts), will be released on 8th November.

# Jermango Dreaming's selection

## Column – Sensuela
_Jermango Dreaming_: **"**Just like every song off this album, Sensuela has the ability to turn any bad/sad mood around. It has been my go-to song to get me through the loss of lovers and the death of friends. It has helped me fall asleep and encouraged me to get up and start my day.**"**

## Poison Abbey – Upmarket
_Jermango Dreaming_: **"**This is the kind of song that could be played on a dancefloor or a Sunday morning kickback and equally fit the vibe – which is my main approach to writing music. Every synth part is perfect, and the vocals take you through the clouds.**"**

## Men I Trust - Numb
_Jermango Dreaming_: **"**What is not to love about this track? Listening to this is what I imagine those anti-anxiety blankets feels like wrapped around you sitting in front of a fire with your warm beverage of choice.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jermango Dreaming - Breeze
_Inès_: **"**xxxx.**"**

## Shane Tyler - Lemurian Promenade
_Inès_: **"**Signed on the same label as our guest this morning, Shane Tyler is the bassist of Gardens & Villa. This track is sunlit pop, effortlessly cool.**"**

## Domenique Dumont - Sans cesse, mon chéri
_Inès_: **"**The most blissful track. It feels the summer version of Jermango Dreaming's description of the Men I Trust track. So calming, like sitting  **"**

## MUNYA - Dove
_Inès_: **"**Ahhh so much love for this track. I become a big fluffy marshmallow when I hear it. My heart melts and everything becomes pink. It feels like going through the first layer of clouds when taking off on a plane. The cutest song and perfect ending for this episode.**"**
