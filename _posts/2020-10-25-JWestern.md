# JWestern's selection

## [Rejjie Snow](https://weyesblood.bandcamp.com/) - Egyptian Luvr
JWestern: **"**Such a groovy beat that you can't help but move to, I love how Rejjie's vocals effortlessly glide over the track and the hook by Dana Williams is killer. Always my go to tune in any mood. The beat was also produced by Kaytranada who I’m a huge fan of, his drums are always so tight and the chords are so soulful and jazzy. Super excited for his new material to come out.**"**

## [Raveena](https://thelemontwigs.bandcamp.com/) - Close 2 U
JWestern: **"**Such a beautiful song, the instrumentation is so gentle and raw that it fits her intimate vocals perfectly; the song itself doesn’t have many layers or changes but for me it suits the vibe. This track always reminds me of my partner in the best possible way and just lounging in the sun surrounded by greenery. I really love all of Raveenas’ material, it all has such a laid-back, melancholic and relaxed feel to it.**"** 

## [Oscar Jerome](https://whitneychicago.bandcamp.com/) - Misty Head / Sunny Street
JWestern: **"**This song has such beautiful instrumentation and a lovely sentiment to match - we could never get tired of listening to it. From the dreamy slide guitars to the brass section, it perfectly captures a sense of nostalgia and longing for a better time, always leaving a smile on our face.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Salarymen](https://salarymen.bandcamp.com/) – Runaway
Sarah: **"**The piano flourish at Runaway's beginning is the perfect introduction into the vibrance of the track. The use of retro synths and analogs (which, according to the band, are "so wonderful but so fragile") shape Salarymen's distinctive recording spirit. There's a natural feel to this release that survived production, giving us Runaway's not-overly-polished groove. Not only was this authenticity the goal of Salarymen, it's also part of their striking charm. Listening to the guitar at the end had me dancing around my bedroom, the energy here is absolutely contagious :)**"**

## [Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys](https://caitlinharnett.bandcamp.com/music) – Make You Feel Blue
Sarah: **"**Salarymen introduced me to this song, and I've been in love with it for the past couple of months. Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys bring country influences to the Australian stage, with such playful and yet nostalgic flourish. The romantic imagery in the lyrics always makes me smile.**"**

## [Laraaji](https://laraajimusic.bandcamp.com/) – Laws of Manifestation
Sarah: **"**I listen to this song every morning, and I now know all the words, even the sequence of sounds at the end. Highly recommend learning them, as I am immediately put into a fantastic mood for the rest of the day with each listen. The celestial zira/mbira instrumentals in the background elevate the track into a walking daydream. The laws of manifestation really are on your side this fine Sunday :)**"**

## [Chico Bernardes](https://chicobernardes.bandcamp.com/album/chico-bernardes) – Me Encontrar
Sarah: **"**So much soul in this track but falling so gently, the power in this song snuck up on me. Brazilian folk artist Chico Bernardes laces his swaying instrumentals with the most marked verses. I've been contemplating over "perdido, no mundo em que eu nasci," meaning I am lost in the world I was born in. Chico Bernardes builds such a lovely and calming space of music to woolgather within, perfect for your Sunday morning.**"**
