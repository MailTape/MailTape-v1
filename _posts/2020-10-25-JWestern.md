# JWestern's selection

## [Rejjie Snow](https://weyesblood.bandcamp.com/) - Egyptian Luvr
JWestern: **"**Such a groovy beat that you can't help but move to, I love how Rejjie's vocals effortlessly glide over the track and the hook by Dana Williams is killer. Always my go to tune in any mood. The beat was also produced by Kaytranada who I’m a huge fan of, his drums are always so tight and the chords are so soulful and jazzy. Super excited for his new material to come out.**"**

## [Raveena](https://thelemontwigs.bandcamp.com/) - Close 2 U
JWestern: **"**Such a beautiful song, the instrumentation is so gentle and raw that it fits her intimate vocals perfectly; the song itself doesn’t have many layers or changes but for me it suits the vibe. This track always reminds me of my partner in the best possible way and just lounging in the sun surrounded by greenery. I really love all of Raveenas’ material, it all has such a laid-back, melancholic and relaxed feel to it.**"** 

## [Oscar Jerome](https://whitneychicago.bandcamp.com/) - Misty Head / Sunny Street
JWestern: **"**This song has such beautiful instrumentation and a lovely sentiment to match - we could never get tired of listening to it. From the dreamy slide guitars to the brass section, it perfectly captures a sense of nostalgia and longing for a better time, always leaving a smile on our face.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [JWestern](https://salarymen.bandcamp.com/) – Let's Disappear
Sarah: **"**The piano flourish at Runaway's beginning is the perfect introduction into the vibrance of the track. The use of retro synths and analogs (which, according to the band, are "so wonderful but so fragile") shape Salarymen's distinctive recording spirit. There's a natural feel to this release that survived production, giving us Runaway's not-overly-polished groove. Not only was this authenticity the goal of Salarymen, it's also part of their striking charm. Listening to the guitar at the end had me dancing around my bedroom, the energy here is absolutely contagious :)**"**

## [Jenny Penkin](https://caitlinharnett.bandcamp.com/music) – Born Last Night
Sarah: **"**Feel the movement in this one :)! The funk bassline delivers a psychedelic dream energy that I could live in forever. Aerial vocals shrouding the percussives make the song feel ethereal.**"**

dojo cuts - rome 
el michels affair - hipps
lady wray - storms
## [Lady Wray](https://caitlinharnett.bandcamp.com/music) – Storms
Sarah: **"**Lady Wray's previous discography (**Get Ready**, **Piece of Me**) solidified a signature 1970's swaying soul influence. Last week's release keeps with her retro inspirations but transcends into something godly. The plunging piano bass laced with Lady Wray's voice and the celestial chorus combine into an almost religious energy. So smooth and so powerful.**"**

## [Chico Bernardes](https://chicobernardes.bandcamp.com/album/chico-bernardes) – Me Encontrar
Sarah: **"**So much soul in this track but falling so gently, the power in this song snuck up on me. Brazilian folk artist Chico Bernardes laces his swaying instrumentals with the most marked verses. I've been contemplating over "perdido, no mundo em que eu nasci," meaning I am lost in the world I was born in. Chico Bernardes builds such a lovely and calming space of music to woolgather within, perfect for your Sunday morning.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thank you so much for listening with us :) Thank you to Salarymen for this electric selection, you were such a joy to welcome to MailTape!
