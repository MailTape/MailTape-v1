<p id="introduction"> This morning we welcome London-based saxophonist and composer, [Camilla George](http://camillageorge.com/), to select three Sunday morning tunes that include some of her inspirations and collaborations.
<br><br>
Born in Nigeria, Camilla George studied at Trinity College of Music and emerged from the influential Tomorrow’s Warriors and Jazz Jamaica bands to a Mobo nomination in 2013. Her tutors have included fellow saxophonists Jean Toussaint, Tony Kofi, Julian Siegel, Christian Brewer and Martin Speake.

# Maria Chiara Argirò's selection

## Jon Hopkins – Emerald Rush
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**[Jon Hopkins](http://jonhopkins.co.uk/) is a very inspiring artist and "Singularity" became a reference electronic album for me in the past year.**"**

## Ambrose Akinmusire – A Blooming Bloodfruit in a Hoodie
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**Such an astonishing composition! [Ambrose](https://www.ambroseakinmusire.com/) is one of my favourite jazz musicians and artists.**"**

## [Andy Shauf](http://www.andyshauf.com/) – Marta Sways
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**I discovered this fantastic songwriter quite recently. Beautiful playing, arrangements and songs. Played this song on repeat.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Maria Chiara Argirò – Nautilus
_Sanjay_: **"**[Maria Chiara Argirò](https://www.mariachiaramusic.com/) returns with 'Nautilus', an expansive soundscape that lifts the the lid on her upcoming second album, [Hidden Seas](https://mariachiaramusic.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-seas).**"**

## Linda May Han Oh – Firedancer
  _Sanjay_: **"**Reminiscent of Miles Davis’s Afrocentric early-‘70s experiments, #BAMboula is an easy-paced groove built upon [Nicholas Payton](http://www.nicholaspayton.com/)’s trumpet and Fender Rhodes. Based on the rhythm of the same name (by the renowned [Louis Moreau Gottschalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Moreau_Gottschalk)), it also includes bits of interviews with Dizzy Gillespie and Art Blakey. Nicholas explains #BAM as an acronymic hashtag for Black American Music.**"**

## Ariwo – To Earth
_Sanjay_: **"**A regular at the Servant Jazz Quarters in Dalston, pianist and composer [Sarah Tandy](https://www.sarahtandy.com/) has recently released her debut album, 'Infection in the Sentence'. This track is built around a nifty electronic motif, starting out pretty leisurely before the theme is tentatively explored with some sensitive sax and Zawinul-like sounds.**"**

## Lifted – Rose 31
_Sanjay_: **"**Previous MailTape guest, [Sarathy Korwar](https://www.mailta.pe/249/sarathy-korwar/), follows up his debut album 'Day to Day' with 'My East Is Your West' alongside the Upaj Collective. And it’s a fantastically good one. Alice Coltrane’s harp in the original version is substituted here by a sitar and santoor—creating a sweltering, exhausting and intense listen at every turn.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to [Camilla George](http://camillageorge.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for his brilliant illustration.</p>
