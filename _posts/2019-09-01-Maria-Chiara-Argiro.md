<p id="introduction"> This morning we welcome London-based saxophonist and composer, [Camilla George](http://camillageorge.com/), to select three Sunday morning tunes that include some of her inspirations and collaborations.
<br><br>
Born in Nigeria, Camilla George studied at Trinity College of Music and emerged from the influential Tomorrow’s Warriors and Jazz Jamaica bands to a Mobo nomination in 2013. Her tutors have included fellow saxophonists Jean Toussaint, Tony Kofi, Julian Siegel, Christian Brewer and Martin Speake.

# Maria Chiara Argirò's selection

## Jon Hopkins – Emerald Rush
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**[Jon Hopkins](http://jonhopkins.co.uk/) is a very inspiring artist and 'Singularity' became a reference electronic album for me in the past year.**"**

## Ambrose Akinmusire – A Blooming Bloodfruit in a Hoodie
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**Such an astonishing composition! [Ambrose](https://www.ambroseakinmusire.com/) is one of my favourite jazz musicians and artists.**"**

## [Andy Shauf](http://www.andyshauf.com/) – Marta Sways
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**I discovered this fantastic songwriter quite recently. Beautiful playing, arrangements and songs. Played this song on repeat.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Maria Chiara Argirò – Nautilus
_Sanjay_: **"**[Maria Chiara Argirò](https://www.mariachiaramusic.com/) returns with 'Nautilus', an expansive soundscape that lifts the the lid on her upcoming second album, [Hidden Seas](https://mariachiaramusic.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-seas). Released on September 27th, Maria's new project features a brilliant line up of musicians including Leila Martial, Sam Rapley, Tal Janes, Andrea Di Biase and Gaspar Sena.**"**

## Linda May Han Oh – Firedancer
  _Sanjay_: **"**Taken from [Linda May Han Oh](https://lindamayhanoh.com/)'s third studio album, Walking Against Wind, 'Firedancer' makes nice use of silence and contrast. Pianist Fabian Almazani and Ben Wendel on tenor saxophone feature prominently on this track—Fabian's left hand in unison with Linda's acoustic bass melody and his right hand punching accents along with Ben Wendel.**"**

## Ariwo – To Earth
_Sanjay_: **"**Ariwo formed in London in 2015 and their debut LP released a couple of years later offered a snapshot of their sound: atmospheric electronica, hypnotising Cuban rhythms and almost transcendental grooves. Pouya Ehsaei, Hammadi Valdes, Orneste Noda and Jay Phelps take their collective name from the Yoruba word for noise. The Yoruba traditions were forcibly transplanted in Cuba during the Middle Passage, with some traces remaining in present-day spiritualism and music.**"**

## Lifted – Rose 31
_Sanjay_: **"**Previous MailTape guest, [Sarathy Korwar](https://www.mailta.pe/249/sarathy-korwar/), follows up his debut album 'Day to Day' with 'My East Is Your West' alongside the Upaj Collective. And it’s a fantastically good one. Alice Coltrane’s harp in the original version is substituted here by a sitar and santoor—creating a sweltering, exhausting and intense listen at every turn.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday for the start of a new season. Much love and respect to [Maria Chiara Argirò](https://www.mariachiaramusic.com/) for kicking it off again with her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for her brilliant illustration!</p>
