<p id="introduction">Welcome back to another season of MailTape! This morning we introduce the London-based pianist and composer, [Maria Chiara Argirò](https://www.mariachiaramusic.com/), who kicks things off again with three Sunday morning tunes.
<br><br>
Maria blends classical music, folk traditions and electronic music with her own approach to harmony and melody. Her most recent venture into electronic genres has helped create more expansive soundscapes which can be heard in her upcoming album [Hidden Seas](https://mariachiaramusic.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-seas) (to be released on 27th September).
</p>

# Maria Chiara Argirò's selection

## Jon Hopkins – Emerald Rush
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**[Jon Hopkins](http://jonhopkins.co.uk/) is a very inspiring artist and 'Singularity' became a reference electronic album for me in the past year.**"**

## Ambrose Akinmusire – A Blooming Bloodfruit in a Hoodie
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**Such an astonishing composition! [Ambrose](https://www.ambroseakinmusire.com/) is one of my favourite jazz musicians and artists.**"**

## [Andy Shauf](http://www.andyshauf.com/) – Marta Sways
_Maria Chiara Argirò_: **"**I discovered this fantastic songwriter quite recently. Beautiful playing, arrangements and songs. Played this song on repeat.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Maria Chiara Argirò – Nautilus
_Sanjay_: **"**[Maria Chiara Argirò](https://www.mariachiaramusic.com/) returns with 'Nautilus', an expansive soundscape that lifts the the lid on her upcoming second album [Hidden Seas](https://mariachiaramusic.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-seas). Released on September 27th, Maria's new project features a brilliant line up of musicians including Leila Martial, Sam Rapley, Tal Janes, Andrea Di Biase and Gaspar Sena.**"**

## Linda May Han Oh – Firedancer
  _Sanjay_: **"**Taken from [Linda May Han Oh](https://lindamayhanoh.com/)'s third studio album, Walking Against Wind, 'Firedancer' makes nice use of silence and contrast. Pianist Fabian Almazani and Ben Wendel on tenor saxophone feature prominently on this track—Fabian's left hand in unison with Linda's acoustic bass melody and his right hand punching accents along with Ben Wendel.**"**

## Ariwo – To Earth
_Sanjay_: **"**[Ariwo](http://www.ariwomusic.com/) formed in London in 2015 and their debut LP released a couple of years later offered a snapshot of their sound: atmospheric electronica, hypnotising Cuban rhythms and almost transcendental grooves. Pouya Ehsaei, Hammadi Valdes, Orneste Noda and Jay Phelps take their collective name from the Yoruba word for noise. The Yoruba traditions were forcibly transplanted in Cuba during the Middle Passage with some traces remaining in present-day spiritualism and music.**"**

## Lifted – Rose 31
_Sanjay_: **"**[Lifted](https://p-a-n.org/release/lifted-2-pan-85/) is a collaborative musical ensemble featuring Future Times boss Max D, Matt Papich aka Co La, Jeremy Hyman and Motion Graphics, as well as contributions from Beatrice Dillon, Bass Clef, Will DiMaggio, Jordan GCZ and more. Late nights and early mornings are blurred in this smoked-out and amorphous joint. 'Rose 31' is brightly lit by mellow flute, woodwind and sax, with an uncomplicated drum pattern shuffling along underneath.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday for the start of a new season. Much love and respect to [Maria Chiara Argirò](https://www.mariachiaramusic.com/) for kicking it off again with her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for her brilliant illustration!</p>
