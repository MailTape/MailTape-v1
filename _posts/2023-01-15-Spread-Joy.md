# Spread Joy's selection

## Marlene Dietrich - I've been in Love before
Spread Joy: **"**A woman that needs absolutely no introduction, Marlene is the original androginous. She's got this way of talking and singing that oscillates between earnesty and disdain which is something I think I do when I sing certain songs too. I grew up watching movies from Pre-Code / Golden Age and these women were always who I emulated.**"**

## [MIKAN MUKKU](https://bitterlakerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/kan-b-w-chin-dan) - Chin Dan
Spread Joy: **"**I feel like my friend Oskar sent this to me in 2016 at like 3AM on a Tuesday or something. It was the perfect moment for a life changing introduction: dark, loud, crashing and moody, oozes 80s coolness, everything I love. I have only ever been able to find a few songs by this group and honestly, every single one is worth a listen.**"**

## [Devon Rexi](https://southofnorthamsterdam.bandcamp.com/album/tambal-ep) - Human Snax
Spread Joy: **"**A contemporary one for the list! This is a new discovery for me and, well, it just bops! ESG-inspired anything deserves a listen and this one gives that energy but Devon Rexi throws in this darker sound that I am always into. Can't wait to hear more stuff by these people, they definitely have my interest!**"**
