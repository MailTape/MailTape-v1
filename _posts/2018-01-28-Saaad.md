<p id="introduction">This morning we are thrilled to welcome Toulouse-based duo [Saåad](http://www.saaadrone.com/) with an eclectic Sunday morning tape.</p>
<p>Descending from the Toulousian post-hardcore scene, Romain Barbot and Gregory Buffier have made a sizeable contribution to the French experimental scene and produced more than a dozen 'ambient-drone' records under the name of [Saåad](http://www.saaadrone.com/). Through dynamics of elevation, suspension and tension, Saåad’s music reaches altered states. Consisting of thick patches of sound, it gathers powerful harmonies and buries them under samples of the world’s rustling sounds.</p>


# Saåad's selection


## Grails – The Burden of Hope
_Romain Barbot_: **"**This track has been my alarm clock for years. It’s still one of my favourite tracks and it gives me chills everytime I listen to it. If the melody is important, the drums parts are pure magic.**"**

## Kurt Vile – Best Love 
_Romain Barbot_: **"**I think it’s the perfect song to manage a Sunday hangover or a good excuse to stay in your bed.**"**

## King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard – Rattlesnake
_Romain Barbot_: **"**I played this album on repeat for months. Surely one of the best records of 2017. This track has the same effect on me as a quadruple espresso.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Saåad – The Harvest
_Sanjay_: **"**Recorded in the Touloulsian Church of Notre-Dame de la Dalbade, Saåad make exceptional use of massive Puget pipe organs originating from 1888. But Romain and Gregory didn't limit themselves to the organs only. They managed to use the entire church with its incredible Renaissance acoustics as a tool to craft a sense of overpowering ambience on Verdaillon, the album from which this track is taken.**"**

## This Will Destroy You – The Puritan (Julianna Barwick remix)
_Sanjay_: **"**Julianna Barwick flips this instrumental into a stripped-down dream. Her voice is barely present here though. Only detectable as a very distant peal flitting around the edges of tumbling pianos, before she introduces a pulsing kick drum and lurching sub-bass.**"**

## Pauline Oliveros – Suiren
_Sanjay_: **"**Based in Paris, Mónica Tavares's (Mo' Kalamity) voice is cool and laid-back, riding atop glossy, elegant yet fiery rhythms by her band, The Wizards.**"**

## Sophia Loizou — Silver Nemesis (Excerpt)
_Sanjay_: **"**Keron's reputation for blending the lyricism of hip-hop with the energy and melody of reggae and dancehall is on full display here: a scathing commentary on the decisions made by Jamaican politicians and neoliberal corporations at the expense of the island’s residents.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all! Thanks for listening and much love to Romain Barbot and Gregory Buffier of [Saåad](http://www.saaadrone.com/) for being our guests today, and to Camille Célestin for this episode's illustration!</p>
