  This morning, we are delighted to welcome Operator Music Band, an art-pop
  quartet from New York. Their music sounds like a tesseract, a nicely
  intriguing and quite complex geometric figure from the fourth dimension that
  can be very surrealistic at first sight. But then, among other things, you
  will perceive a deep love for analogue synths, an interesting sense of humor,
  a vocal and instrumental surgical precision, no matter if you suck at
  mathematics.

# Operator Music Band's selection


## [Here We Go Magic](http://herewegomagicband.tumblr.com/) - Over the Ocean
_Alejandro Salazar Dyer_: **"** There's a meticulous, dreamy/hypnotic charm that weaves its way through this song and puts me at ease... **"**

## Washington Phillips - Lift Him Up That's All
_Gabe Pittleman_: **"** Gospel blues from the ‘20s played on an unidentified homemade instrument. Simple and pretty and a little otherworldly. Melts my cold atheist heart. **"**

## Aye Aye - Wila Wila
_Dara Hirsch_: **"** Most, if not all tracks, that Cómeme (Chilean house label) releases resonate with me, but [Wila Wila](https://ayexaye.bandcamp.com/album/wila-wila) is especially chilling. The instrumentation is wacky and the vocals are entrancing. What more could you ask for? **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Operator Music Band - Creative Tube Bending
_Charlotte_: **"** I discovered [Operator Music Band](https://operatormusicband.bandcamp.com/) after hearing this track: there are so much things going on during 3’50! It's like being agreeably trapped between a disco night club and the CBGB in a 90's video game. **"**

## Suzy Andrews - Teenage Iceage (Vermelho Edit)
_Charlotte_: **"** My brother is ten years younger than me. He is still in his phase when all the bands (and mostly all the people from his entourage) who are born before the 21st century are totally uncool. Last week, we were sending music to each other and I made him discover this track, which he liked quite a lot. Maybe because I didn’t tell him the song was initially released in 1982. **"**

## Eye - Le Croquis de la Femme
_Charlotte_: **"** [Le Croquis de la Femme](https://wavinghandsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/le-croquis-de-la-femme) is from a 2 tracks EP of the same name. It’s a tale about a mistress and a murder, an excessive passion with two lovers full of madness. But since this song has no lyrics, you can imagine a totally different story. Personally, I have no idea why but when I listen to it, I simply see water calmly boiling in a blue saucepan. **"**

## [Abner Jay](https://littleaxerecords.bandcamp.com/album/abner-jay-true-story-of-abner-jay) - Saint James Infirmary Blues
_Charlotte_: **"** Every time I hear 'Saint James Infirmary Blues' I imagine myself old. I will have a turtle called Phalanx and finally know how to cook. I will probably also talk to my mailbox and have purple hair because I will have failed my color, but I'm fine with all of it. **"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Operator Music Band](https://operatormusicband.bandcamp.com/) for being our guest this week, and to Camille Célestin for this episode’s illustration!</p>
