# MailTape's selection

## [The Lazy Eyes](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/music) - Cheesy Love Song
Sarah: **"**SongBook is a wonderful listen from start to finish. All the tracks meld together into a psychedlic haze, each subsequent tracks adding more complexity to the album's complete picture. This is the album's final track, leaning into the rock influences more heavily than some of the earlier numbers.**"**  

## [Damu the Fudgemunk](https://damuthefudgemunk.bandcamp.com/), [Raw Poetic](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/music) - Power of the Mind
Sarah: **"**Raw Poetic is dominating this playlist, but there was simply too much to choose from. One of the many collaborations between Damu the Fudgemunk and Raw Poetic, this track is lifted from Damu's alum [Conversation Peace](https://damuthefudgemunk.bandcamp.com/album/conversation-peace). Struck by the xylophone with the easy energy of the rap verses. Love the sax and piano openings towards the end, smooth :)**"**

## [DARGZ](https://dargz.bandcamp.com/), [Moses Boyd](http://www.mosesboyd.co.uk/) - Happiness
Sarah: **"**The piano and synth spirals weaving around the bass section are absolutely intoxicating. One of the latest singles from producer DARGZ, off of the [Happiness EP](https://dargz.bandcamp.com/track/happiness-feat-charlie-stacey-moses-boyd). Really nice placement in the release, adding some instrumental breath before Hold On, Pt. 2, starting the EP nicely.**"**

## [The Lazy Eyes](https://indiablue.bandcamp.com/) - Where's My Brain???
Sarah: **"**Finishing off this eclectic selection with a track from India Blue's 2022 album, [The Circus Came and Left](https://indiablue.bandcamp.com/album/the-circus-came-and-left). Love the vocal layering on this one. Calming and yet celestial, a testament to India Blue's self descriptions as faerie-folk. Wonderful for pulling yourself out of a sleepy morning.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That finishes our playlist  for this morning! Our thanks to [Raw Poetic](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/music) for his wonderful Sunday selection. Many thanks to No√©mie Dijon for this episode's stellar illustration!</p>
