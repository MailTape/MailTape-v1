# MailTape's selection

## [The Lazy Eyes](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/music) - Cheesy Love Song
Sarah: **"**SongBook is a wonderful listen from start to finish. The tracks meld together into a psychedelic haze, each track adding more complexity to the album's complete picture. This is the album's final track, leaning into the rock influences more heavily than some of the earlier numbers.**"**  

## [Janko Nilovic and the Soul Surfers](https://damuthefudgemunk.bandcamp.com/) - Psychic Powers
Sarah: **"**The newest release from Janko Nilovic and the Soul Surfers.**"**

## INO hidefumi - スカイツリー / Skytree
Sarah: **"**Can't get over the easy going groove in this track, perfect for a Sunday morning :) Wonderful plucking accents halfway through, such a nice compliment to the rhythm sections' sliding movements**"**

## [The Lazy Eyes](https://indiablue.bandcamp.com/) - Where's My Brain???
Sarah: **"**Finishing off our selection with another track off of the band's debut album. The title is self-explanatory enough, this track's psychedelic influences create the space to get lost in. Love the rock breaks from the trancelike grooves, a really fun listen.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That finishes our playlist  for this morning! Our thanks to [The Lazy Eyes](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/music) for joining us this Sunday. Many thanks to Meriam Kharbat for this episode's vibrant illustration!</p>
