<p id="introduction">This morning, let us keep you on the edge of new talent discovery with the latest essentiels. Introducing [Stand Wise](https://soundcloud.com/standwise), an intriguing duo from Paris and their selection of fine tunes.</p>

# Synth' out

Feeling blessed lately? I don't like to talk much about religion but I often feel music is the only avatar worth worshiping on this earth. Landing the unanimous consensus of the living peers, never revoked, it pokes the jokes out of your degenerated mind, calming its overreacting neurons and reviving dead cells through apoptosis. 
Sunday's the day for revival, some see it as the last, but I like to see it as the gate of entry into another week of uncertain affluence. Turn up the volume, but not too high, as this MailTape is for the travelling mind of a mature soldier needing a little assistance with flesh effervescence.

_Recondite_, little known or obscure isn't what this track resonates in all of us. Like a manifestation of dancing thoughts parading around a glass globe. Avid visitor of the frequency garden, passing through, letting go, letting light, allowing this next track to keep you on track. _Alma Construct_ has me on the edge, on the tipping point of an internal chemical reaction, and yet you'll burst, and flirt with the dangers of a firing heart palpitation. Colorado 's _Undisclosed_ is a surprise from Bretagne, acknowledge its originality and dive into the otherside with [Stand Wise](https://soundcloud.com/standwise). An apprenticeship for the new comers of the synthesizer Galaxy. _David August_ needs no intro, his talent multiplies with time and "The Acid" squashes all existing doubts of his supremacy. Carrying on, hold still, just wait for it and the day will unfold just like slow magic.
 
# Stand Wise's selection:

## Recondite - Robur
_Stand Wise_: "You wake up at dawn, the weather is freezing and the sky is grey. You put on Robur and it wraps you up for just a few minutes, allowing you to exit your cocoon more peacefully. A light kick, some deep base and airy synths: the perfect remedy for a soft awakening."

## Alma Construct - On The Edge, Surrounded With The Shores Of Assudrey
_Stand Wise_: "To listen to on a rough morning.
You slept very little and can hardly stand, but you must somehow reconnect. On the edge is your wing man, allowing you to resurface. This track leaves you no choice. Like a sharp scream echoing in your head. "Wake-up". Your body, heavy and wasted soon reponds: the base quickly jolts you out of it."

## Colorado - Undisclosed
_Stand Wise_: "You wake up in the best mood ever! You know you're off for a trip today. You get in your car and take off. The dreamy synths, the patterns of the drums straight out of a rock band, the unexpected vocals, without forgetting the bridge with the kitsch sonority. There lies the strength of Undisclosed, a track from the talented young duo from Brittany."

If you believe that great music rhymes with good food, we truly recommend you to discover _Animal Kitchen & Records_, Stand Wise's record label, the first hybrid music label mixing musical production ([Animal Records](https://www.facebook.com/animalrec/)) and food ([Animal Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/AnimalKitchen/)). And for our epicurean Paris-based music lovers, Animal Kitchen just took control of the parisian venue Point Ephémère's kitchen...</p>
