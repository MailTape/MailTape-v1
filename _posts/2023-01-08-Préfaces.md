# Préfaces's selection

## The Walkmen - I Lost You
Préfaces: **"**I was really inspired by how this band revived a lot of the 50's and 60's aesthetics in their music. Surg guitars, showmanlike vocals, high-pitched cinematic organs etc. Most importantly the layered rhythms led by cymbals and percussion instead of being based on kick and snare drums.**"**

## Bob Azzam - Till 
Préfaces: **"**The spare exotica instrumentation, the inimitable hall reverb, the unshameful melodrama, the haunting flute, but on top of it all the voice of Bob Azzam, who could sing in multiple languages and displays here remarkable restraint, with a dynamic range and vibrato control that would make the Rat Pack drop their dry martini's to the floor. This is not surf music but it has an approach to sound and a sense of false naivety that we tried to capture on Prefaces' first LP, notably on Farah el Zaman & Helwet el Midan. **"**

## The Ventures - Maria Elena
Préfaces: **"**Romantic guitars have always spunk me in the most nostalgic way. I think most of my guitar playing is based on those melodies that I have heard over and over again throughout my entire life. The Ventures have shaped the sound of my guitar, when played naturally and have certainly shaped the vision of what Prefaces means to me. Let the guitar sing, speak, tell you the story of unfulfilled love.**"**
