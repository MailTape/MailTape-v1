<p id="introduction"> This morning, I'm not going to serve you the usual, redundant "Happy New Year," even if the heart is there. But on Mailtape we wish you still full of beautiful musical discoveries here and elsewhere and to share them as much as possible. . . And for this first episode of 2023, the band Préfaces is honored to share their playlist with us.
 
</p>

# Préfaces's selection

## The Walkmen - I Lost You
Préfaces: **"**I was really inspired by how this band revived a lot of the 50's and 60's aesthetics in their music. Surg guitars, showmanlike vocals, high-pitched cinematic organs etc. Most importantly the layered rhythms led by cymbals and percussion instead of being based on kick and snare drums.**"**

## Bob Azzam - Till 
Préfaces: **"**The spare exotica instrumentation, the inimitable hall reverb, the unshameful melodrama, the haunting flute, but on top of it all the voice of Bob Azzam, who could sing in multiple languages and displays here remarkable restraint, with a dynamic range and vibrato control that would make the Rat Pack drop their dry martini's to the floor. This is not surf music but it has an approach to sound and a sense of false naivety that we tried to capture on Prefaces' first LP, notably on Farah el Zaman & Helwet el Midan. **"**

## The Ventures - Maria Elena
Préfaces: **"**Romantic guitars have always spunk me in the most nostalgic way. I think most of my guitar playing is based on those melodies that I have heard over and over again throughout my entire life. The Ventures have shaped the sound of my guitar, when played naturally and have certainly shaped the vision of what Prefaces means to me. Let the guitar sing, speak, tell you the story of unfulfilled love.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## Préfaces - Kaher El Kheil
Anaïs G: **"** Ce groupe libanais n'a rien a envié de ces grands noms. Digne de bande sons de films, il nous plonge dans un univers cinématographiques entre musique des années 60, rockeurs du dimanche et histoire romantique devant 

**"**

## Liraz Naz - Azizam
Anaïs G: **"**A beautiful discovery that this Israeli-Persian singer and her music hypnotizes me from the first notes of music. Oriental rhythms, punctuated by sensual voices singing in farsi, and mixed with the Iranian pop of the 70s gives us an explosive result in the ear, an exceptional cocktail!**"***

## Altin Gün - Leylim Ley
Anaïs G: **"**A nugget straight out of a turkish-dutch band that I love to listen to so much, and with their album "Yol" that seduced me so much already 2 years ago. But while waiting for their new album to be released in March, we enjoy this first track which is a cover of a Turkish classic. Stories of lost love and exile, a popular title worth a visit!**"**

## Derya Yıldırım & Grup Şimşek - Bal
Anaïs G: **"**Pour clore cette sélection, rien de mieux qu'un titre de ce groupe d'origine turc basé à Berlin. Toujours hypnotisant et psychédélique dans leur son qui remet au gout du jour des balades folkloriques des années 70.Un plaisir pour les oreilles mais aussi pour les yeux avec leurs clips colorés et psyché !**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much thanks to Préfaces for these fantastic Sunday selections, and many love to   for this episode's wonderful illustration !</p>
