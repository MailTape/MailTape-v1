# Préfaces's selection

## The Walkmen - I Lost You
Préfaces: **"**I was really inspired by how this band revived a lot of the 50's and 60's aesthetics in their music. Surg guitars, showmanlike vocals, high-pitched cinematic organs etc. Most importantly the layered rhythms led by cymbals and percussion instead of being based on kick and snare drums.**"**
