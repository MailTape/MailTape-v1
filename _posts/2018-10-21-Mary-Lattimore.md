<p id="introduction">This Sunday morning we are delighted to welcome harpist [Mary Lattimore](http://marylattimoreharpist.tumblr.com/) to MailTape. By now I've forgetten the summer. I don’t remember what the morning is. It has merged into a fading white light, when that morning has awakened and too quickly ceased. Mary's own sound on her latest album, [Hundreds of Days](https://marylattimoreharpist.bandcamp.com/album/hundreds-of-days), as well as her selections this morning capture this feeling plainly.
<br><br>
If you're in London Mary will be playing live with Lucinda Chua in support at [The Lexington](http://thelexington.co.uk/event.php?id=315) on Monday 19th November. She'll also be supporting Kurt Vile alongside Meg Baird at the O2 Empire Shepherds Bush on Tuesday 6th and Wednesday 7th November.</p>


# Mary Lattimore's selection

## Brian Eno – Fullness of Wind
_Mary Lattimore_: **"**I like the idea of listening to classical music on a Sunday morning and I love this morphed version of the Canon in D, which I've played millions of times before at weddings. It's real weird to my ears, and totally luxurious and beautiful.**"**

## Henryk Górecki - Third Symphony Movement 3
_Mary Lattimore_: **"**This one is pretty heavy and gorgeous and makes your heart feel something. I can see it being really luminous and not as sorrowful on a Sunday morning as late on a Saturday night. You can design your own context for such a glowing thing, sometimes. **"**

##  Baird Sisters – Tracks
_Mary Lattimore_: **"**[The Baird sisters](http://www.thebairdsisters.com/), Meg and Laura, are both super musicians on their own, but combined, their sister-harmonies and sister-instincts are clear and fun to admire. I love this song. **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Mary Lattimore - Hello From the Edge of the Earth
_Inès_: **"**Jerry Paper is... versatility. I’ve actually discovered him with MailTape (thanks [Aldous RH](https://www.mailta.pe/274/aldous-rh/) and [Hector Gachan](https://www.mailta.pe/289/hector-gachan/)!) and I’ve been impressed by the different musical genres he takes on while maintaining his identity. But the thing I love the most in his music is its realness. His lyrics are smart, honest, and he knows how to sing about feelings without making it too whiny or awkward. His music is a gentle reminder that life is absurd and that nothing really matters (but in a good way).**"**

## Áine O'Dwyer – Tremor
_Inès_: **"**It has been a while since I’ve listened to a song on repeat. This song is so filling, so calming, so dreamy. Hazes of pastel blue and pink and yellow. A spring Sunday morning surrounded by cherry blossoms.**"**

## Orla Wren – The Cup Of Remembered Things (w/ Aaron Martin & Isnaj Dui)
_Inès_: **"**Alright, another John Cage themed song. Extremely chill song turning out a bit more nightmarish at the end. It layers out so nicely though. Plus, seagull sounds are always nice to hear.**"**

## United Bible Studies – Hazlehurst Requiem
_Inès_: **"**I wanted to mirror Jerry Paper's last pick with a kind of similar one. I've inadvertently liked a few Avventur songs before realising that they were from the same artist. I honestly wouldn't be able to describe what their music is. It's cool. This track feels like moving forward when facing super strong winds.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As alwaysn thanks so much for listening! Big love to [Jerry Paper](https://jerrypaper.bandcamp.com/) for his great selection, and to [Camille Céléstin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for the amazing illustration! Have a colourful Sunday!</p>
