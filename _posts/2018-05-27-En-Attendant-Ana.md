<p id="introduction">This morning, we are delighted to welcome the garage pop band [En Attendant Ana](https://enattendantana.bandcamp.com) for a bright-eyed MailTape that might help you leave your bed.</p>
<p>The Parisian quintet has just released their first album 'Lost and Found' in April. And while the RATP’s (transport company for Paris) lost property offices handle over 500 000 items a year, the 13 powerful and faux-naïf songs of the LP are enough to place En Attendant Ana as a very promising band.</p>


# En Attendant Ana's selection


## Electrelane – The Greater Times
_En Attendant Ana_: **"**We didn’t even know [Electrelane](https://www.facebook.com/electrelane/) until Nicolas Pommé told us we sounded a bit like them. We started to listen and instantly fell in love with their work. We've been listening ever since!.**"**

## Entracte Twist - Christine Young
_En Attendant Ana_: **"**[Entracte Twist](https://www.facebook.com/EntracteTwist/) is the first band we played with at our very first gig in 2015. From there, we started hanging out with them from time to time because they were cool! Later, Adrien joined the band and when we performed in public for the first time, Entracte Twist played after us once again. Destiny...**"**

## Joujou Jaguar - Into The Grave (Guitar Hero Version)
_En Attendant Ana_: **"**Some of us used to organize gigs in Paris from 2014 To 2017. We invited [Joujou Jaguar](https://joujoujaguar.bandcamp.com/) to play one of our nights and from there we began a great friendship! The band is composed of members of our label, Buddy Rec. And their EP Avant Vancouver was released (on tape) by Montagne Sacrée which is our second label here in France. And after all, our buddies are the best we have.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## En Attendant Ana - Ré
_Charlotte_: **"**I wanted to start running but had no motivation. A friend made me a playlist that I could listen while I go jogging and where 'Ré'  was featured. I never went but I’ve kept listening this song and then [En Attendant Ana](https://enattendantana.bandcamp.com/)’s whole album.**"**

## Snail Mail - Thinning
_Charlotte_: **"**[Snail Mail](https://snailmailbaltimore.bandcamp.com/) is the project of the singer Lindsey Jordan that she started in 2015 when she was 16. She is the living proof that adolescence, besides acne and social dramas, can also produce good things such as this song.
(And for those who are in Paris, the band is going to play for free this afternoon at the Villette Sonique festival.)**"**

## Corridor - Coup d'épée
_Charlotte_: **"**I went to a concert where we were 8,5 in the audience (the guy from the merchandising had put his earplugs and was reading a book about gardening) and the band on stage was pretty unhappy about it. They performed like their instruments were dead and didn’t bother to notice us or even each other. After this disappointing show, I was tired but the friend with who I was insisted to go to an other gig. When we walked into the venue, [Corridor](https://corridormtl.bandcamp.com/) were playing this catchy song and were the first band’s opposite : glowing and warm (and good!). They kind of saved my evening.**"**

## Le Villejuif Underground - Cold Dark Place In Your Art
_Charlotte_: **"**Last I heard, three of [the band](https://www.facebook.com/levillejuifunderground/) members still live together in a house and one of them in a hut deep down its garden in Villejuif, a quiet suburb of Paris. Their singer, the Australian Nathan Roche is what we can commonly call a « fake slaker ». Before he moved to France a couple of years ago at 26, he had already released a dozen albums, published around twenty novels and poetry collections full of absurd and surrealistic stories. This song is a good way to introduce yourself to his labyrinthine work.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it! Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [En Attendant Ana](https://enattendantana.bandcamp.com/) for being our guest today, and to Camille Célestin for this episode’s illustration!</p>
