<p id="introduction">This morning, we're back and on fire! Our guest is parisian producer, **[Monomotion](https://www.facebook.com/monomotionmusic/?fref=ts "Monomotion's Facebook page")**. His last EP _Behind the moon_ is pure magic. One year after its release, it's always a delight to dive into its organic songs. There's a force in it that surround your heart and soul to give you power. We tried to live up to this in today's episode.</p>
 
# Monomotion's selection:

## Stormzy - Shut Up
_Monomotion_: **"**Stormzy is one of the uprising UK Mc i've been following since a while now, and I really love how the panflute sounds and the colours of the synths in it. He has his own rapping style that I like!**"**

## Edyth - Agua Verde
_Monomotion_: **"**I love the samples of this track, how it's used, and how the song evolves with different theme parts.**"**

## FEYNMAN - The Farewell Courtyard
_Monomotion_: **"**I really love the chords, and the progression. The évolution is perfectly created through the build-up and the organic mixdown is one of my fav.**"**

# Mailtape's selection

## Monomotion - Blue Hell Island
_Louise_: **"**It's one of my favorite track of the EP. It gives me so much energy everytime I listen to it. So much happens in this one track, it's a blast. Can't even tell what I love the most. Is it the bassline which make me dance? Or this organic mess that we can hear above? It makes my head spin. _Behind The Moon_ EP was definitely one of my favorite record in 2015, anyway!**"**

## aetherworld. - Aeon of Aether
_Louise_: **"**Pure talent. That's what I thought when I discovered Teodor Vasilev's songs. To me, his universe is part cinematic and part syfy. The atmosphere of his songs makes me escape from space and time.**"**

## Nym - Come Back
_Louise_: **"**« _When I was a kid, I used to stare out the car window and pretend that I was flying_ ». Best intro ever, do I need to say more? 
Well, I will... This producer come from San Fransisco and is signed on amazing Loci Records. This song comes from the album _Convex_. I really love the concept of the album : "_It's about how simple things are more complex upon closer inspection_" **"**

## Roméo Elvis x Le Motel - La Voiture
_Louise_: **"**« Surprising choice » you may say. Actually, not that much. I really thought Le Motel's production was working perfectly with the rest of the selection. Roméo Elvis is a Belgian rapper who is, I think, really talented. I love how he tells stories. His rhymes and the music match in the best way.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Monomotion](https://soundcloud.com/monomotionmusic "Monomotion on Soundcloud") for his selection. We hope you enjoyed this episode. Tell us if you liked this experimentation we made on the text. Enjoy your Sunday!</p>
