<p id="introduction"> This morning, we shake up codes, habits and routine. We will experience music in different ways, touch it, feel it, see it in such a way that it transcends us, disturbs us, shakes us. . .
<br><br>
To do this exercise early in the morning, [Spelterini](https://www.kythibong.org/fr/bands/spelterini) provided us with a hell of a playlist. You will even experience their more or less surprising music through their latest LP released last October under the label [Kythibong](https://store.kythibong.org/). An ideal musical journey for an introspection of our body and mind on this Sunday morning.
</p>

# Spelterini's selection

## [Laddio Bolocko](https://laddiobolocko.bandcamp.com/) - Goat Lips
Spelterini: **"**Killer piece of music by a NYC band from the past. If you like it gritty.**"**

## [Horse Lords](http://horselords.org/) - Against Gravity
Spelterini: **"**Arty piece of music by an existing Baltimore band. If you like it microtonal.**"**

## [The Necks](https://www.thenecks.com/) - Rum Jungle 
Spelterini: **"**Fantastic piece of music by a 35-year-old Australian band. Take some time off, close your eyes and listen to the whole piece. If you like it trippy.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## Spelterini - Paréidolie
Anaïs G: **"**This group, like a tightrope walker on a wire, like [Maria Spelterini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Spelterini) their muse, tells us a story and embarks us on a most disturbing journey. In their latest LP “[Paréidolie](https://store.kythibong.org/album/par-idolie)” released last October by [Kythibong](https://store.kythibong.org/), their minimalist post-punk destabilizes us and moves us into our hitherto entrenchments to reveal faces, abstract lines. To live without moderation!**"**

## Bothlane - Nog 
Anaïs G: **"**Discovered at the time with his music video “[Hornet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xxGCxHKzQI)”, I followed the beautiful trajectory of Alain Deval alias [Bothlane](https://bothlane.bandcamp.com/). This Liège drummer masters perfectly the drums but also the synthesizers. A music that you can enjoy after at friends' house and especially live on stage. An explosion of emotions, sounds and beats of all kinds going from afro/jazz to noise/techno with an ease that one remains speechless.**"**

## The Brums - Bunch
Anais G: **"**The wonderful band The Brums has already been featured in Mailtape with an episode that lives up to our expectations. In the episode, highlighting the band Spelterini, it seemed obvious to me to talk about this amazing band again (where we also find Alain Deval aka Bothlane). Charmed with their title “[Fuzzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSUw9HKK2YE)” by their music but also by the clip, he always amazes us as much with their latest EP “[No Encore](https://thebrums.bandcamp.com/releases)” released under the fabulous [Luik Music label](https://www.luikmusic.be/). The fireworks in your ears!**"**

## La Colonie de Vacances - Alex Weir 
Anaïs G: **"**Just to be awake this Sunday morning, a song by [La Colonie de Vacances](https://lacoloniedevacances.com/) from their latest album “[Echt](https://lacoloniedevacances.com/music/)” released this year under [the label Vicious Circle](https://www.viciouscircle.fr/fr/accueil). Mixture of maths, noisy, experimental, this quadraphony places the audience at the center so that they can experience it as an adventure. I experienced it and it was an enormous and pleasant surprise for me!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [Spelterini](https://store.kythibong.org/album/par-idolie) these thoughtful Sunday selections, and many thanks to Lucy for this episode's stunning illustration !</p>
