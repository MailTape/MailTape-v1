<p id="introduction">This morning, we welcome [Ursula's Cartridges](https://vimalapons.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape for an electro selection. 

As Vimala Pons performs it in her latest show "[Le Périmètre de Denver](https://www.theatre-contemporain.net/spectacles/Le-Perimetre-de-Denver/lesdates)" we may not be one but many. Many things, many people, many stories. It's time more than ever to foolishly incarnate them all and blossom to your best like plants in spring. And music is the best igniter for that. Put the volume up, wake up your neighbors!
</p>

# Ursula's Cartridges' selection

## VHS Head - Body Magic
Ursula's Cartridges: **"**This guy released the best album of the 2010's and it's all about sampling b-movies and old television commercials! Retrofuturistic audiovisual onslaught that sticks to your ear like ketchup on a white t-shirt.**"**

## [Dream Frequency](https://peachesofficial.bandcamp.com) - Take Me (The Prodigy Mix)
Ursula's Cartridges: **"**Thanks to my brother I got to listen to lots of early 90s dance and rave music when it was still a new thing. To this day I still cherish those days fondly. I find modern (dance) music extremely poor when comparing it to the 90s. Music used to have memorable melodies and hooks that still sound fresh. Now it's replaced by bass and noise that nobody can't stand listening to while sober.**"**

## [Eveline Fischer](https://mmodemm.bandcamp.com/album/das-kinn-mdm-5) - Submap Shuffle
Ursula's Cartridges: **"**The music of Donkey Kong Country 3 is one of my all-time favourite video game music soundtracks. It manages to add ambiance with a massive amount of unique sounding echoing bass structure in the background, making it sound grand, mysterious and even playful. Unlike in other "DKC" games, the music was mostly composed by Eveline Fischer with a minor help by David Wise. Fischer does a surprisingly fine job and manages to compose music that can compete with Wise's work, although she relies on ambient elements whereas Wise's music is more melodical. Overall, the music of "DKC3" was an instant favourite to my eight year old mind. Before that i never knew about the genre of "ambient music" but i've always enjoyed the music style. I remember listening to the overworld theme ("Northern Kremisphere") and the world map theme ("Submap Shuffle") nonstop without playing the game at all. Just sitting and enjoying the game world and thinking about all the millions of possible hidden places it included. The repetitive synthesizer melodies, low pitch drums samples and low bass ambient patterns are an irresistible immersion to the game and this "three element symbiosis" repeats in several other levels as well.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Vimala Pons](https://vimalapons.bandcamp.com/) - Eusapia Klane Remembers
Sarah : **"**Enter the abstract world of Eusapia Klane, one of the characters from Vimala Pons' latest show "[Le Périmètre de Denver](https://www.theatre-contemporain.net/spectacles/Le-Perimetre-de-Denver/lesdates)". Glowy colors, flashy streets, a geometrical car... what do you see behind your close eyelids when listening to this story?

This is the first chapter of an audio story she wrote and produced as a spinoff. I love the freedom she takes here to create a refreshing unidentified sound object. What if it was all a story from the beginning? Do we really need to be serious? Do you believe in truth?**"**  

## [Boy Harsher](https://boyharsher.bandcamp.com) - Tears
Sarah: **"**Talking about freedom... Let's ride with Eusapia in our shiny stolen car, listening out loud to Boy Harsher. It's Sunday morning but this track takes me right to Friday night, I feel I need that kind of raw and hot energy in these days. Don't you?**"**

## [Emily Wells](https://emilywells.bandcamp.com) - Love Saves The Day
Sarah: **"**Slow down, let's park there, in front of this wild forest calling us. The stereo still goes on, waves from Emily Wells' violin entering the woods. Lights on a couple of magnificent and bi-centennial oaks, humans dancing and sending joyful energy through their vibration communicated to the mycelium down there.**"**

## [Antoine Bellanger](https://antoinebellanger.bandcamp.com) - Il se frotte contre l'écorce et de son bras coule l'étoile.
Sarah: **"**The whole forest is ready to reply and tell its story now.. Stop the engine, let's walk in...**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this Sunday morning :) Infinite thanks to [Vimala Pons](https://vimalapons.bandcamp.com/) for such a refreshing selection. It wasn't easy to complete it and I had much pleasure doing my curation. Great thanks also to Thibault Daumain for his colorful illustration!</p>
