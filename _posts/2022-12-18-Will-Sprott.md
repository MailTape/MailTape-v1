Based in California, [Will Sprott](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/)'s music stretches from folk to rock n roll to soul to space country. He is an active vocalist and guitarist in the wonderful group [Shannon and the Clams](https://shannonandtheclams.bandcamp.com/album/year-of-the-spider). His most recent solo album was entitled [Ten Fingers](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/album/ten-fingers), leaving us eager for what he releases next.

# Will Sprott's selection

## [Pearls Before Swine](https://pearlsbeforeswineusa.bandcamp.com/album/balaklava) - Sail Away
Will Sprott: **"**This song has been one of my favorites for years. It starts out so raw with the voice loud & clear & grows into this lush universe of swirling harp & psychedelic guitar & then see-saws back & forth, gaining & losing momentum. It has beautiful lyrics too.**"**

## [Shana Cleveland](https://shanacleveland.bandcamp.com/album/night-of-the-worm-moon) - Invisible When the Sun Leaves
Will Sprott: **"**[Shana Cleveland](https://shanacleveland.bandcamp.com/album/night-of-the-worm-moon) is one of the greatest songwriters ever. She oozes creativity. I know because we live in the same house & I watch the songs pour out of her day after day. This song about night time descending over the earth captures a feeling that I love.**"**

## [Sun Ra](https://sunramusic.bandcamp.com/) - Bye Bye
Will Sprott: **"**Sun Ra has so many good records that you can put on & let your thoughts drift around in. I like the early doo-wop recordings he made. There is a lot of eerie, unearthly doo-wop music out there but his is extra strange because he’s Sun Ra & he’s from space.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Will Sprott](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/) - A Dog Will Love You When Nobody Else Will
Sarah: **"**This track is off of Will Sprott's solo album Vortex Numbers. Love the guitar riffs running all the way through it, there's such a soulful, timeless quality in the track. Perfect for a smooth moving Sunday morning :)**"**

## [Troll Dolly](https://trolldolly.bandcamp.com/album/heavens-mini-mart-3) - Microcosms
Sarah: **"**This track arrives off of Troll Dolly's June album  [Heavenly Mini Mart](https://trolldolly.bandcamp.com/album/heavens-mini-mart-3). The whole release is full of bright melodies weaved into webs of sound, I keep going back to this track. Jen Yakamovich's vocals are beyond mesmerizing.**"**

## [Shannon and the Clams](https://shannonandtheclams.bandcamp.com/album/year-of-the-spider) - Vanishing
Sarah: **"**Obsessed with this last track off of Shannon and the Clam's 2021 album, [Year of the Spider](https://shannonandtheclams.bandcamp.com/album/year-of-the-spider). Shannon Shaw's vocals open the track to new heights, absolutely timeless. The keyboard embellishments toward the end veil the track in a levitating, dreamy quality.**"**

##  [Lizette & Quentin](https://lizettequevin.bandcamp.com/album/grow-forever-b-w-now-it-s-your-turn-to-sing) - Grow Forever
Sarah: **"**Really like this duo's dynamic, so tender and timeless. The soul ballad traces over such beautiful chords and dancing guitar riffs, I love hearing the horns come in half way through.**"**
