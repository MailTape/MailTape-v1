<p id="introduction"> This Sunday, we welcome in the morning with Will Sprott. His dreamy selection brings in a lot of light with it, gifting us some surprising finds with winding melodies. Based in California, [Will Sprott](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/)'s music stretches from folk to rock n roll to soul to space country. He is an active vocalist and guitarist in the wonderful group [Shannon and the Clams](https://shannonandtheclams.bandcamp.com/album/year-of-the-spider). His most recent solo album was entitled [Ten Fingers](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/album/ten-fingers), leaving us eager for what he releases next.

# Will Sprott's selection

## [Pearls Before Swine](https://ablenoise.bandcamp.com/releases) - Sail Away
Will Sprott: **"**This song has been one of my favorites for years. It starts out so raw with the voice loud & clear & grows into this lush universe of swirling harp & psychedelic guitar & then see-saws back & forth, gaining & losing momentum. It has beautiful lyrics too.**"**

## [Shana Cleveland](https://www.marinarosenfeld.com/) - Invisible When the Sun Leaves
Will Sprott: **"**Shana Cleveland is one of the greatest songwriters ever. She oozes creativity. I know because we live in the same house & I watch the songs pour out of her day after day. This song about night time descending over the earth captures a feeling that I love.**"**

## [Sun Ra](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/album/networker) - Bye Bye
Will Sprott: **"**Sun Ra has so many good records that you can put on & let your thoughts drift around in. I like the early doo-wop recordings he made. There is a lot of eerie, unearthly doo-wop music out there but his is extra strange because he’s Sun Ra & he’s from space.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Will Sprott](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/) - A Dog Will Love You When Nobody Else Will
Sarah: **"**This track is off of Will Sprott's solo album Vortex Numbers. There's such intricate webs of melody in this track.**"**

## [Troll Dolly](https://chassol.bandcamp.com/) - Microcosms
Sarah: **"**Love this track off of Troll Dolly's June album  Heavenly Mini Mart. **"**

##  [Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/) - Potion Trouble
Sarah: **"**Distort the music, in order to have a raw look and feel the simplest emotions. It’s kind of what you feel when you listen to this song “Potion Trouble”.Repetitive in the rhythms but at the same time hypnotizing, I also advise you to go listen to his first album released at the end of 2020 with notably the title “[Spiritismes et Nouvelles Technologies](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/track/spiritisme-et-nouvelles-technologies)”.**"**

## [Shannon and the Clams](https://loyamusic.bandcamp.com/) - Vanishing
Sarah: **"**Love this last track off of Shannon and the Clam's 2021 album, Year of the Spider.**"**
