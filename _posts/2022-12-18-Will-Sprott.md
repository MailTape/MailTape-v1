<p id="introduction"> This morning, we explore, we dematerialize, we deconstruct the music. We beat it to find inspiration, we saturate it to its fullest, we look for the unknown, the astonishing, the shocking, the disconcerting in order to touch. This is what Tachycardie offers us through this playlist.
<br><br>
Through his EP “[Nouvelles et Anciennes Pratiques de Cartographie Amateure](https://tachycardie1.bandcamp.com/album/nouvelles-et-anciennes-pratiques-de-cartographie-amateure)”, Tachycardie offers us a different experience, a different way of seeing and consuming music. Only you can judge this one because it is an adventure in itself. It’s worth a visit!

# Tachycardie's selection

## [Pearls Before Swine](https://ablenoise.bandcamp.com/releases) - Sail Away
Will Sprott: **"**This song has been one of my favorites for years. It starts out so raw with the voice loud & clear & grows into this lush universe of swirling harp & psychedelic guitar & then see-saws back & forth, gaining & losing momentum. It has beautiful lyrics too.**"**

## [Shana Cleveland](https://www.marinarosenfeld.com/) - Invisible When the Sun Leaves
Will Sprott: **"**Shana Cleveland is one of the greatest songwriters ever. She oozes creativity. I know because we live in the same house & I watch the songs pour out of her day after day. This song about night time descending over the earth captures a feeling that I love.**"**

## [Bye Bye](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/album/networker) - Sun Ra
Will Sprott: **"**Sun Ra has so many good records that you can put on & let your thoughts drift around in. I like the early doo-wop recordings he made. There is a lot of eerie, unearthly doo-wop music out there but his is extra strange because he’s Sun Ra & he’s from space.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Tachycardie](https://tachycardie1.bandcamp.com/) - Pratiques IV & V
Sarah: **"**Musical exploration, unstructured sounds, Tachycardie wants us to think about music differently. As a vibratory art using instruments or materials but also in we offer a free vision, another album format under the name of “Nouvelles et Anciennes Pratiques de Cartographie Amateure”, with several pieces proposed as a kind of “cinema for the ears. ” We are going through several emotions at once before we understand the concept of this musician.**"**

## [Chassol](https://chassol.bandcamp.com/) - Pipornithology, Pt.1
Sarah: **"**Chassol is one of my must-haves. Whether this pianist is solo or accompanied by other singers such as [Bonnie Banane](https://bonniebanane.bandcamp.com/), he is right in the way he treats music and sound, touching where it is needed, with that subtlety and sensuality, thus leading us into his world. In the album “[Big Sun](https://chassol.bandcamp.com/)” I always had a preference for the title “Bird, Pt.1”, with those sounds of birds, so light, natural and beautiful. But this time by sticking closer to the music offered by Tachycardie I wanted to show a side of him even more offbeat and crazy with the title “Pipornithology, Pt.1.”**"**

##  [Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/) - Potion Trouble
Sarah: **"**Distort the music, in order to have a raw look and feel the simplest emotions. It’s kind of what you feel when you listen to this song “Potion Trouble”.Repetitive in the rhythms but at the same time hypnotizing, I also advise you to go listen to his first album released at the end of 2020 with notably the title “[Spiritismes et Nouvelles Technologies](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/track/spiritisme-et-nouvelles-technologies)”.**"**

## [Loya](https://loyamusic.bandcamp.com/) - Zenfant
Sarah: **"**To finish this daring playlist, it seemed logical to propose Loya. This native Reunion, offers us a music influenced by his culture by mixing electro with Maloya. “Zenfant”, one of the tracks from the album “[Corail](https://loyamusic.bandcamp.com/album/corail)” transcends us and touches us in the depths of us!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us.
