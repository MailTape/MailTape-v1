<p id="introduction"> This Sunday, we welcome in the morning with Will Sprott. His dreamy selection brings in a lot of light with it, gifting us some surprising finds with winding melodies. Based in California, [Will Sprott](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/)'s music stretches from folk to rock n roll to soul to space country. He is an active vocalist and guitarist in the wonderful group Shannon and the Clams. His most recent solo album was entitled Ten Fingers, leaving us eager for what he releases next.

# Will Sprott's selection

## [Pearls Before Swine](https://ablenoise.bandcamp.com/releases) - Sail Away
Will Sprott: **"**This song has been one of my favorites for years. It starts out so raw with the voice loud & clear & grows into this lush universe of swirling harp & psychedelic guitar & then see-saws back & forth, gaining & losing momentum. It has beautiful lyrics too.**"**

## [Shana Cleveland](https://www.marinarosenfeld.com/) - Invisible When the Sun Leaves
Will Sprott: **"**Shana Cleveland is one of the greatest songwriters ever. She oozes creativity. I know because we live in the same house & I watch the songs pour out of her day after day. This song about night time descending over the earth captures a feeling that I love.**"**

## [Sun Ra](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/album/networker) - Bye Bye
Will Sprott: **"**Sun Ra has so many good records that you can put on & let your thoughts drift around in. I like the early doo-wop recordings he made. There is a lot of eerie, unearthly doo-wop music out there but his is extra strange because he’s Sun Ra & he’s from space.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Will Sprott](https://willsprott.bandcamp.com/) - Pratiques IV & V
Sarah: **"**Musical exploration, unstructured sounds, Tachycardie wants us to think about music differently. As a vibratory art using instruments or materials but also in we offer a free vision, another album format under the name of “Nouvelles et Anciennes Pratiques de Cartographie Amateure”, with several pieces proposed as a kind of “cinema for the ears. ” We are going through several emotions at once before we understand the concept of this musician.**"**

## [Troll Dolly](https://chassol.bandcamp.com/) - Microcosms
Sarah: **"**Love this track off of Troll Dolly's June album  Heavenly Mini Mart. **"**

##  [Danse Musique Rhône-Alpes](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/) - Potion Trouble
Sarah: **"**Distort the music, in order to have a raw look and feel the simplest emotions. It’s kind of what you feel when you listen to this song “Potion Trouble”.Repetitive in the rhythms but at the same time hypnotizing, I also advise you to go listen to his first album released at the end of 2020 with notably the title “[Spiritismes et Nouvelles Technologies](https://dmra.bandcamp.com/track/spiritisme-et-nouvelles-technologies)”.**"**

## [Loya](https://loyamusic.bandcamp.com/) - Zenfant
Sarah: **"**To finish this daring playlist, it seemed logical to propose Loya. This native Reunion, offers us a music influenced by his culture by mixing electro with Maloya. “Zenfant”, one of the tracks from the album “[Corail](https://loyamusic.bandcamp.com/album/corail)” transcends us and touches us in the depths of us!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much thanks to [Will Sprott](https://tachycardie1.bandcamp.com/) for these fantastic Sunday selections, and many love to [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/julie_wo/) for this episode's wonderful illustration !</p>
