<p id="introduction">This morning, we're lucky to have the mysterious [Randy Goffe a.k.a HOME](https://www.facebook.com/homemusicofficial/) as our guest. Coming from Florida, his retro-futuristic sound is on its way to invade brains all over the world. Kaleidoscopic beats, japanese psyche-rock, vintage synths, and much more... Let's fly.</p>

# Wave-olution

If there's one Bandcamp you should listen to at the moment, it's [HOME's one](https://home96.bandcamp.com). He's only 20 and with already 2 albums released he's creating some of the most interesting vintage synth beats at the moment. If you miss the beginnings of folks like Com Truise, Tycho, Neon Indian... HOME's beats have this tasty feelings you've been looking for.

With such humble presence, to the point we couldn't get any portrait from him, Randy says clearly what's his priority. And music it is. But what elevates his art to another level comes from his storytelling ability through music. As waves create the envelope to let the mind wonder, he takes us on a meditative journey with his oniric melodies. And all that from the confort of your home, where we always come back after all.

# HOME's selection:

## Homeshake - Faded
_HOME_: "I've been a huge fan of this guy for almost a year now, I fell in love with his first full length In The Shower when I was finishing up my second album towards the end of 2014, and it's followup Midnight Snack is a really cool step in a slightly more electronic direction. Really wavy R&B influenced stuff with a lot of cheesy synths. Perfect soundtrack for lying in bed on your phone for half an hour before finally deciding to get up."

## Chrome Sparks - Lost In The Chrome Forest
_HOME_: "This track is one of my favorites, really simple synth sounds and a cool hook, very dreamy."

## A.K. Paul - Landcruisin'
_HOME_: "I was so stoked when I saw this track a few days ago, I've been waiting for new Jai Paul for ages and I guess his brother would be the next best thing I could ask for. Really wonky, disjointed sound, cool synths and drums. I had it on in the background this morning while I was setting up to record some demos."
