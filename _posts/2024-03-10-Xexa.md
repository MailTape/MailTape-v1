# XEXA's selection

## Umalali & The Garifuna Collective - Nibari

**XEXA**: **"**Umalali & The Garifuna Collective is an ensemble that captures the power and uniqueness of Garifuna female expression. A culture situated on the Caribbean coast, Garifuna traditions blend elements from Native Caribbean heritage with West African. Over the years, Umalali has recorded more than 50 women of many generations from Garifuna communities, many of whom had never been recorded before. I personally love the force and wisdom that this song emanates.**"**

## Bassekou Kouyate & Ngoni Ba- Jonkoloni

**XEXA**: **"**Ngoni is a string instrument found throughout West Africa. The ngoni instrument has the particularity of producing melodic rhythms. Jonkoloni is a track that is part of Segu Blue album, from the malian artist Bassekou Kouyate and his band Ngoni Ba. Segu Blue is a record filled with warm yet intricate sounds, textures and history. The lead singer of this track is Ami Sacko, Bassekou Kouyate's wife.**"**

## SPAZA -  Magwinya, Mangola neWhite Liver

**XEXA**: **"**The energy, the sonic storytelling ,the slow sensation of progression culminating in ? Some sort of introspection. There is always a strong sense of ceremony in SPAZA songs. As if the songs themselves are a ritual. Very inspiring compositions.**"**
