<p id="introduction">
This morning, we're unveiling a diverse selection of tracks covering many sensibilities, all filled with vibrant spirit. We're extremely happy to have [XEXA](https://principediscos.bandcamp.com/album/vibrac-o-es-de-prata) opening this episode, taking us from the Caribbean Coast to Mali, South Africa, and many other destinations around the world.
<br><br>
Her freshly released <em>"Vibrações de Prata"</em> on the excellent Lisboan record label [Príncipe](https://principediscos.bandcamp.com/music) is an immersive sonic trip that challenges the relationship one has with music and sound. Her track featured here acts as a portal to embark us on another dimension where listening and breathing form a common movement.

# XEXA's selection

## [Umalali & The Garifuna Collective](https://garifunacollective.bandcamp.com/album/umalali-the-garifuna-womens-project) - Nibari

**XEXA**: **"**Umalali & The Garifuna Collective is an ensemble that captures the power and uniqueness of Garifuna female expression. A culture situated on the Caribbean coast, Garifuna traditions blend elements from Native Caribbean heritage with West African.

Over the years, Umalali has recorded more than 50 women of many generations from Garifuna communities, many of whom had never been recorded before. I personally love the force and wisdom that this song emanates.**"**

## [Bassekou Kouyate & Ngoni Ba-](https://bassekou-kouyate.bandcamp.com/album/ba-power) Jonkoloni

**XEXA**: **"**Ngoni is a string instrument found throughout West Africa. The ngoni instrument has the particularity of producing melodic rhythms. Jonkoloni is a track that is part of Segu Blue album, from the malian artist Bassekou Kouyate and his band Ngoni Ba. Segu Blue is a record filled with warm yet intricate sounds, textures and history. The lead singer of this track is Ami Sacko, Bassekou Kouyate's wife.**"**

## [SPAZA](https://spaza.bandcamp.com/album/spaza?from=search&search_item_id=2350156432&search_item_type=a&search_match_part=%3F&search_page_id=3251685026&search_page_no=0&search_rank=2&logged_in_menubar=true) -  Magwinya, Mangola neWhite Liver

**XEXA**: **"**The energy, the sonic storytelling ,the slow sensation of progression culminating in ? Some sort of introspection. There is always a strong sense of ceremony in SPAZA songs. As if the songs themselves are a ritual. Very inspiring compositions.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [XEXA](https://principediscos.bandcamp.com/album/vibrac-o-es-de-prata) - Fragmented Breath

**ImaCrea**: **"**It wasn't easy to choose just one track from XEXA's album, as I feel it functions as a cohesive whole. However, the track I've selected encapsulates a story in itself, evoking imaginary landscapes populated with magical creatures, and somehow the entire environment feels dynamic and spiraling.

I must add that this album has become the soundtrack to a book I'm currently reading, adding a dimension I feel was necessary for me to fully immerse myself in it. The track I'm referring to is *"Croire aux fauves"* by Nastassja Martin. Thank you, Ametonyo, for offering me this precious book.**"**

## [African Head Charge](https://africanheadcharge.bandcamp.com/album/a-trip-to-bolgatanga) - Accra Electronica

**ImaCrea**: **"**With the intricate previous tracks, I was really tempted to delve into other works that are very introspective and immersive. But somehow, to reflect XEXA's opening selection, and also because I feel the energy is shifting towards the outside world and towards others as Spring is approaching, I decided to follow another direction. Vibrant, lively, and inviting to be together and dance.

XEXA's selection transported me across the ocean, and somehow I stumbled upon the latest album by African Head Charge, a collaboration between the master Jamaican percussionist Bonjo Iyabinghi Noah and English dub producer Adrian Sherwood, and the crush was instant.**"**

## [Lionmilk](https://lionmilk.bandcamp.com/track/changin) - Changin'

**ImaCrea**: **"**Coffee, tea, or whatever you prefer should be warm and ready at this point. Sunrays are drawing zebras across the windows on your plants. There will be better times ahead; let's keep hope alive and share love with courage.**"**

## [Les Imprimés](https://lesimprimes.bandcamp.com/album/r-verie) - Love & Flowers

**ImaCrea**: **"**What if it wasn't all politics? What if we were making mistakes? Are we truly in control? Why all the hate? How long will it last? How do we derail the train of thoughts and let our hearts speak again? Let's detach from fear and offer some flowers to a stranger today.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks for being with us. Thank you [XEXA](https://principediscos.bandcamp.com/album/vibrac-o-es-de-prata) for this magical selection and thank you André to introduce me to XEXA's music.
