# Lecomte de Brégeot's selection

## [Dina Summer](https://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/) - Uranos
Lecomte de Brégeot: **"**Typically my kind of song, a catchy bass line merging dark and sexy vocals, so 80's but with a contemporary vibe, perfect for the dancefloor.**"**

## [Hypnotic Brass Ensemble](http://www.yoshihirohanno.com/discography/) and [Mick Karn](https://mickkarn.net/) - Now
Lecomte de Brégeot: **"**One of my last crushes, so pop, so romantic, and all these vintage synths are exactly what I could use for my own productions.**"**

## [Matia Bazar](https://johnpowellmusic.com/) - Elettrochoc
Lecomte de Brégeot: **"**I recently discovered this song while touring in Brazil, I like when artists are taking risks, the first time I heard it, I was really surprised, kind of unexpected to get this wacky vocal line on this groovy instrumental, highly creative :)**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Lecomte de Brégeot](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/album/any-day-now), Violet Chachki, Allie X - Mistress Violet
Sarah: **"**The latest track from Yannick, a collaboration with queer icon Violet Chachki and Canadian artist Allie X. I heard this intoxicating synthwork poking through the mists of a queer Brooklyn nightclub and was instantly obsessed. The velvet vocals against such punchy basslines and intricate synthwork are classic and surprising at the same time.**"**

## [Cakes da Killa](https://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/compositions-sorted.html), Sevndeep - Sip of My Sip
Sarah: **"**Off of the latest album from Cakes da Killa, Svengali. Cakes da Killa is doing so much for intersections in hip hop, club, and ballroom scenes. This latest album is such a melange of different movements, from rousing to meditative.**"**

## [Wajatta](https://omnigardens.bandcamp.com/) - Marmite
Sarah: **"**So much momemtum in this track buildup, especially with these percussives :) The vocals of Reggie Watts and John Tejada are so dynamic, at times speaking/whispering between accents, singing riff melodies, even making percussive sounds; in vibrant conversation and collaboration with the track underlays.**"**

## [Lecomte de Brégeot](https://elorisaxl.bandcamp.com/album/the-blue-of-distance) - Nerves
Sarah: **"**Another track from Lecomte de Brégeot to close out this playlist. As always, the retro rippling basslines cast a Lecomte's signature over the track. The synths are intimidating and yet inviting at once, I love how the vocals and cymbals whisper to each other at the track's build :) Yannick speaks about the story of songs, and the narrative he seeks to tell with the build and fall of each track. **"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning's selection! Thank you for joining us, we hope you danced :) Our love to Lecomte de Brégeot for these wonderful Sunday selections, and many many thanks to [Camille Célestin](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's fantastic illustration!</p>
