# Lecomte de Brégeot's selection

## [Dina Summer](https://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/) - Uranos
Lecomte de Brégeot: **"**Typically my kind of song, a catchy bass line merging dark and sexy vocals, so 80's but with a contemporary vibe, perfect for the dancefloor.**"**

## [Hypnotic Brass Ensemble](http://www.yoshihirohanno.com/discography/) and [Mick Karn](https://mickkarn.net/) - Now
Lecomte de Brégeot: **"**One of my last crushes, so pop, so romantic, and all these vintage synths are exactly what I could use for my own productions.**"**

## [Matia Bazar](https://johnpowellmusic.com/) - Elettrochoc
Lecomte de Brégeot: **"**I recently discovered this song while touring in Brazil, I like when artists are taking risks, the first time I heard it, I was really surprised, kind of unexpected to get this wacky vocal line on this groovy instrumental, highly creative :)**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Lecomte de Brégeot](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/album/any-day-now) - Mistress Violet
Sarah: **"**The first track I discovered from Yannick, this intoxicating bassline swirling in the mists of a Brooklyn nightclub. This collaboration with Violet Chachki is so provocative and **"**

## [Omni Gardens](https://omnigardens.bandcamp.com/) - Algae After All
Sarah: **"**This track brings us to another world, brimming with the filminess of green underwater flora, stretching upwards to a speckled surface in the distance. I used this track in my play for brainscape and aquascaping scenes, the harmonies here transport you to the swaying micro worlds of green and growth. (side note: r mccarthy's [Jyoti](https://infinitebisous.bandcamp.com/track/jyoti) also featured to give a sounded body to this otherworldly space). The synth work's exploratory melody along with the droning hums of these undertones feel healing in some sense, like you're growing roots and new leaves just by listening to it -- living a newfound peaceful life as a patch of algae :)**"**

## [Paul Lansky](https://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/compositions-sorted.html) - Her Voice
Sarah: **"**On our last class of the semester, my music professor introduced us to Paul Lansky's [exploratory](http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/liner_notes/fantasies.html) 1994 album, [Fantasies and Tableaux](https://www.newworldrecords.org/products/paul-lansky-fantasies-and-tableaux). This is the first track off the release, and after listening through the rest of the collection, it's still my favorite ([Her Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lppSwmBBmOk) is a close second). The production process here is interesting, Paul Lansky uses his wife's voice as a technical instrument for the entire piece (bassline, chords, etc.), producing some of the synthwork with linear predictive coding. I love the haunting quality of his resulting product, approaching the uncanny valley of voice but still with the underlying romantic context to make me smile.**"**

## [Lecomte de Brégeot](https://elorisaxl.bandcamp.com/album/the-blue-of-distance) - Nerves
Sarah: **"**Another track from Lecomte de Brégeot**"**
