We introduce you Crackazat, exceptionally gifted House music producer. Raise in UK, Benjamin Jacobs lives now in swedento be closer to his label, "Local Talk", which distils the most classy contemporary house music.</p>

# as a shapeshifter
Electronic Hip-Hop beats, soulful grooves, classy house and most of all: jazzy melodies. That's the Formula ! Crackazat also goes to tribal and exotic beats sometimes, but his touch his already recognized and appreciated at fair value. 

B. Jacobs is a Jazz musician and musician teacher in Upssala, and of course of course it's reflected in his productions, more detailed and richer than average. His debut album, out this year, contain some tracks that are already classics. "Eye Light", "Let Love" or "Somewhere Else", these are tracks that seem to have always been there. As restless as rich in musical arrangements, his album is a sign of an undeniable talent.

## Skalpel - Sculpture
Crackazat: **"**_A great wake up track, taken from on of my favorite trip-hop/nu-Jazz albums. The rest of the album fantastic. It's simply self titled 'Skalpel' and was released on 2004 on ninja tune._**“**
 
## Sameed - Blue
C.: **"**_Like myself, DJ/Producer Sameed has released music on swedish house label 'Local Talk'. 'Blue' is a blissful and soothing piece of house music, with a supremely soulful feeling. It's gorgeously musical and I love the harmony._ **"**
