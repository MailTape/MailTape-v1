# Luis Ake's selection


## Walls & Birds - You To Sleep On
Luis: **"**It is really hard to decide for one Walls & Birds song since they’re all so perfect and share a feeling which is really resonating with me. Not only musically on a really high level but also lyricwise I am 1000% sold! Walls & Birds are really innovative and have been super inspiring for me.**"**

## Юные волны - Творожное Озеро (Curd Lake - Young Waves)
Luis: **"**Curd Lake is a band I just recently discovered. All their EPs are super good and range from ambient instrumental songs to more pop influenced songs. I think already they are on of my favorite russian synth projects next to Leto V Gorde and Talnik.**"**

## Frau Tod - Mondblau
Luis: **"**Really beautiful synth album with pieces of lyrics from Paul Celan and also Frau Tod himself, who is also known as Violet, Nicki Fehr or his band project ooi. I think I listened to this album at least a million times.**"**
