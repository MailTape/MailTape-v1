<p id="introduction"> This morning, whether you are just waking up or coming home from Saturday's night-out, put your sandals and your socks on and get your vulnerable feelings and your late-night dance moves ready. [Luis Ake](https://luisake.bandcamp.com/) is taking you on an odd trip in his golf club cart, can't you feel your hair blowing in the wind already?

# Luis Ake's selection

## Walls & Birds - You To Sleep On
Luis: **"**It is really hard to decide for one [Walls & Birds](https://wallsandbirds.bandcamp.com/) song since they’re all so perfect and share a feeling which is really resonating with me. Not only musically on a really high level but also lyricwise I am 1000% sold! Walls & Birds are really innovative and have been super inspiring for me.**"**

## Творожное Озеро - Юные волны (Curd Lake - Young Waves)
Luis: **"**[Curd Lake](https://tvorozhnoeozero.bandcamp.com/) is a band I just recently discovered. All their EPs are super good and range from ambient instrumental songs to more pop influenced songs. I think already they are on of my favorite russian synth projects next to Leto V Gorde and Talnik.**"**

## Frau Tod - Mondblau
Luis: **"**Really beautiful synth album with pieces of lyrics from Paul Celan and also [Frau Tod](https://frautod.bandcamp.com/) himself, who is also known as Violet, Nicki Fehr or his band project ooi. I think I listened to this album at least a million times.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Luis Ake - Bitte Lass Mich Frei
Jules: **"****"**

## Teplice - Late In The Day
Jules: **"**[Teplice](https://teplicemusic.bandcamp.com/releases)**"**

## Céu - Perfume Do Invisível
Jules: **"**[Céu](https://ceumusic.bandcamp.com/)**"**

## Grauzone - Eisbär
Jules: **"**Although Grauzone had little success in the 1980s, Eisbär is certainly the most famous hit of Stefan and Martin Eicher's group, and a very special song for me. It's the kind of song that allows you both to dance to in a club and listen to home-alone. Punk influences can carry harsh melancholic feelings and I am sure even polar bears need to cry sometimes.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning, thank you so much for listening! Much love and respect to Luis Ake for his wonderful Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
