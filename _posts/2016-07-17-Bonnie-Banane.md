<p id="introduction">This morning, we will have you experience the steadily progressive sound of a Parisian artist called [**Bonnie Banane**](https://www.facebook.com/bonniebananemusique/). Having launched, “Soeur Nature,” a few months ago, she’s left quite an indelible impression on the independent RnB scene. </p>

# The Chanteuse in the making 

With a voice as distinctive as hers, she's all set to take you on a nostalgic jaunt through the 90’s American style Hip Hop and RnB, whereas rest of the selection is only a dose of the happiness pill she likes to consume daily.  

# Bonnie Banane's selection:

## Willow Smith - twentyfourtyeight 2.0
_Bonnie Banane_: **"**I like this song from Willow while drinking cold water when I wake up.
Tons of water.**"**

## George Duke - Tzina
_Bonnie Banane_: **"**Then I put on George Duke, right before I make my bed and open the windows
letting fresh air come through. I stretch legs too.**"**

## Lala &Ce 67 - Jessica Jones
_Bonnie Banane_: **"**Lala &ce, right before I get out to get some fruits and hot bread with my lover
come back and eat slowly. That's a good sunday morning for me.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Bonnie Banane](https://www.facebook.com/bonniebananemusique/) for her selection. Enjoy your day everyone!</p>
