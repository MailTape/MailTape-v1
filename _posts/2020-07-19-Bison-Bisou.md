<p id="introduction">This morning, we are on our way to the holidays, ready to dive into the waves dressed in our best swimsuit. To accompany these first hours of sunshine and warm sand on our bodies nothing better than Bison Bisou to warm up the atmosphere even more.
  
It is under this pretty name that he destroys the codes and creates the contrast with their music. Powerful rock to wake up your body, and your mind, Bison Bisous understands that. A soundtrack accompanying our energetic mornings running on the beach or our long summer evenings around a fire with friends.

# Bison Bisou's selection

## Jenny Hval - The Great Undressing
Bison Bisou: **"**The way Jenny Hval criticizes capitalism and sexism is so sweet and pure. This song is one of the most clever lullabies ever. Marvelous like a never-ending-wishing dream.**"**

## Girl Band - Shoulderblade
Bison Bisou: **"**We expected a lot from Girl Band after listening to their music and watching their lives for a while.We weren’t disappointed when we saw their new video for Shoulderblade : after countless times seeing it, we still share the same weird shiver, out of some sort of post-industrial transe. It's the ideal song to wake up on a sunday in a dying city.**"** 

##  - 
Bison Bisou: **"**5, 6, 7, 8 in the morning. Walking to the sunrise. Music from broken-mirror smartphone invading the streets. Wondering if you’re a god or a dog, the party was raw. You’re alone in this world like the sun in our solar system.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Bison Bisou – Peaches Forever
Anaïs G: **"**"Pain & Pleasure", released last October, is an album that accompanied me this winter and again throughout this confinement, during these two months. I didn't think I'd be so turned on by their music, so it was hard for me to choose just one song among the eleven, but I set my heart on Peaches Forever, which represents perfection! Sweet and energetic moments, for a Sunday morning in subdued tones!**"**

## Hidden Fees – So What
Anaïs G: **"**A band straight out of New York, with an old school song with tunes by Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stone. Sunny and motivating to attack the week ahead!**"**

## Mama's Gun – Shield & Shelter
Anaïs G: **"** Limoge découverte local rock **"**

## Moon Duo  – Sleepwalker
Anaïs G: **"**  **"**
