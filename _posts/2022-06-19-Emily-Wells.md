<p id="introduction">This morning, I am very thrilled to unveil an episode co-curated with Emily Wells. As she's on tour, playing ["Regards to the End"](https://emilywells.bandcamp.com/album/regards-to-the-end) around the world, she took a moment to share with us some of her music gems. With this selection, embark on a positive and deep journey filled with moving energy. Dance, love, care.

# Emily Wells' selection

## Nina Simone - Who Knows Where the Time Goes 
Emily Wells: **"**This recording puts you in the room: the single pair of hands clapping at the entry of the vocals somewhere in the back of the room; Nina Simone’s voice low, steady, kind; and the hiss of the tape and the atmosphere of the room, somewhere in the middle of the 1960s calling out to us in the present. When the tremolo on the Rhodes comes in, it sounds like a theremin or as though it might come from the throat of a creature that lives beneath the sea. The sound and its execution feels utterly contemporary, of the future. Every note played or struck or sung is as sure and sad as a note can be.**"**

## [Penny Penny](https://pennypenny.bandcamp.com/album/shaka-bundu) - Shaka Bundu
Emily Wells: **"**I discovered Penny Penny when I was “resting” after my first vaccine dose. I’d given myself permission to lie on the couch with the shades drawn and listen to music all day. I went deep into an “Awesome Tapes from Africa” well and ordered a summer’s worth of vinyl, Penny Penny’s being one of them. This album was recorded in South Africa in 1994. Penny Penny has a remarkable story and his music bops, seek him out!**"**

## [Empress Of](https://empressof.bandcamp.com/) - Save Me
Emily Wells: **"**The song makes me feel good. Put it on and dance. Go on a drive and try to keep the windows up. Run, run faster. Uhhh the production: the pacing, the disco strings, the space between the sounds, the melodies. This is the kind of Sunday I want to have.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Emily Wells](https://emilywells.bandcamp.com/) - All Burn, No Bridge
ImaCrea: **"**When I discovered Emily Wells' music, it sounded like a natural echo to my inner flow of the moment. With vast landscapes, deep heartful intensity coupled with a powerful force. Her latest album ["Regards to the End"](https://emilywells.bandcamp.com/album/regards-to-the-end) is an antidote to keep fighting for hope and light. This track reminds me of the kind of flow I could find when listening to Philip Glass' music but now twisted with a furious and irresistible grandioso groove. A perfect soundtrack for your next trip.**"**

## [Oliver Sim](https://oliversim.bandcamp.com) - Hideous
ImaCrea: **"**Oliver Sim, from The XX, is unveiling track by track his first solo project. Each track is a masterpiece and I felt this one was particularly perfect to play just after Emily Wells as I see it as a way to keep pushing the pleasure a bit further.**"**

## Six Drummers - Doctor Doctor Give Me Gas (In My Ass) Pt. 2
ImaCrea: **"**I can't say anything about it here as I'd be afraid to spoil the fun. So. There's a movie. It's from Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjärne Nilsson. It's called "The Sound of Noise". Don't watch any trailer, just watch it directly without any more information. Then you'll understand.**"**

## [Hamid El-Shaeri](https://habibifunkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/habibi-funk-018-the-slam-years-1983-1988) - Reet
ImaCrea: **"**Complete change of scenery here with Hamid El-Shaeri, creator of ["Al Jeel"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jeel) music genre. A complete music landscape I know so little about, I feel lucky I discovered his music recently. A new door opens to so many future discoveries !**"**
