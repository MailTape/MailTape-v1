# Sierra Manhattan's selection

##  Js Donny - Purple 1
Sierra Manhattan: **"**My friend Sarah Myy mixed this track on a sunday afternoon in Lille where I was playing with my solo project Bravo Tounky. Been listening to their music on loop ever since. I also really love their band Donna Candy which is obviously the best punk / noise band alive. Js Donny gave me faith in guitars again, haha !**"**

## AG Cook  - Animals
Sierra Manhattan: **"**It would be an enormous lie to tell that this person’s music wasn’t an huge influence on everything I did musically since almost ten years. I don’t think you can very much hear it in anything I do but his music unlocked so many process on using computer sounds, electronic drum kits, voice effects and basically emancipate myself from a basic pop/rock kind of making music.**"**

##  Kraftwerk - The Hall of Mirrors
Sierra Manhattan:**"**Florian (Sierra Manhattan’s drummer and producer of the album) left this tape in our van after our last tour and I stumbled upon this track that I totally forgot. Such a huge hit, gives me the thrills every time… Highly recommended soundtrack to drive just after sunset.**"**
