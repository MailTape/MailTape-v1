<p id="introduction">
	This morning, we are delighted to welcome Marseille-based producer, musician, DJ, singer, and MC (she can do it all) [Goldie B](https://www.facebook.com/goldiebmusic), to MailTape! On this Sunday, as the clouds gather above Paris, from where I am writing, let us hope that her selection, coming straight from the south of France, will warm our spirits.
	<br><br>
	From episodes of unsettlingly prolonged warmth to sudden waves of cold that prick our senses, this October month seems undeniably changed. Looking at the news, depicting a world more and more fragmented and battered, I can't help but think, selfishly, that Sunday mornings will likely never be the same again. When I reached out Bonnie told me that, under her DJ alias Goldie B, more accustomed to nightlife, blissful Sunday morning playlists aren't her forte. But it matters not. The mother of [Omakase Recordings](https://omakaserecordings.bandcamp.com/) embraced the challenge, drawing from her diverse musical journey, delivering a selection that builds bridges and transcends boundaries, always inviting us to rise from our beds and reinvent everything.

# Goldie B's selection

## Hania Rani - Leaving

Goldie B: **"**To start this Sunday morning's musical selection, there's no doubt in my mind—I've chosen one of the sublime pieces by the Polish pianist and singer [Hania Rani](https://haniarani.bandcamp.com/). I first encountered her on the extraordinary Gondwana Records label. This specific track, featured on her 2020 album "Home," has become somewhat of an obsession for me. Hania's music is like a complete cinematic experience, ready to send shivers down your spine with every soaring note and every moment of silence. As a pianist myself, I share a particularly profound connection with the way she uniquely wields this instrument. I find myself passionately enamored with her music, truly captivated by its beauty.
**"**

## Sunday Service Choir - Rain

Goldie B: **"**My second choice for this Sunday morning selection is a beautiful gospel track from the Sunday Service Choir, a group led by the artist and producer Kanye West and conducted by choir director Jason White. I want to emphasize that I'm personally not a believer, but the spiritual dimension invoked by the musicality and the sheer power of gospel music transcends me in a way that's undeniably special. This track, built in crescendo, is a masterpiece in both its vocal arrangements and orchestration and I think it serves as a poignant reminder of the universal capacity of music to touch our spirits and unify us through a shared encounter with the sublime and the emotional.
**"**

## Moloko - Sing It Back (Original Version)

Goldie B: **"**Alright, the last one's a true classic, But in the end, not this original version, which, in my opinion, is much more sensational than Boris Dlugosh's widely-known club remix. My final pick for this selection is the one that motivates me to leave my bed and start dancing (laughs). It's an incredibly sensual track, with a progression that suits my tastes perfectly, combining finesse and power. The introduction is exquisitely crafted, featuring jazz brush drums, percussive artistry, the seductive vocals of Róisín Marie Murphy, and the mesmerizing Rhodes... It's truly fantastic, very elegant, and at the same time, it turns quite wild towards the end of the song. A masterpiece!

# MailTape's selection

## Goldie B - Something Nu

Jules: **"**There was already MBKONG, her neo-soul project, the eclectic music of Omakase Recordings, and Goldie B was the DJ alias under which she graced clubs and festival stages. With the release of her debut EP <i>Nu Are</i>, [Goldie B](https://omakaserecordings.bandcamp.com/album/goldie-b-nu-area) temporarily sets aside the turntables to fully immerse us in her rich and rhythmic universe, drawing influences from jazz to breakbeat, jungle to UK beat. This track, that opens the EP, is a reflection of it, gentle before the rhythm sweeps us away. It's like a desire to leave the club for open air, return, leave again, and never rest.**"**

## Sofia Kourtesis - How Music Makes You Feel Better

Jules: **"**After several singles and EPs that contributed to her rapid rise in the electronic music scene, [Sofia Kourtesis](https://sofiakourtesis.bandcamp.com/album/madres-2)' upcoming debut album <i>Madres</i> emerges as a more intricate piece, dedicated, evidently, to her mother who recently battled and triumphed over cancer. This track, with its evocative title, teeters between fear and invincible hope, blending the sounds of Peru, her country of origin, with those of Berlin, her adopted home, oscillating between melancholy and a joyful energy that calls for action.**"**

## Simo Cell - rainbow dance

Jules: **"**<i>rainbow dance</i> is a blissful track taken from <i>Cuspide Des Sirènes</i>, [Simo Cell](https://simocell.bandcamp.com/album/cuspide-des-sir-nes-album)'s longly awaited debut solo album. On this album, the French DJ/producer demonstrates that his talents extend far beyond the boundaries of club culture. Blending influences, and atmospheres, mixing tempos, and emotions, his music seems equally suited for dreamy nights as it is for the uncertain mornings to come.**"**

## [Ela Minus & DJ Python](https://elaminus.bandcamp.com/album/ep) - Kiss U

Jules: **"**After two acclaimed solo albums, the ♡ (referred to as “corazón”) EP marks the first collaboration between Ela Minus' poignant singing and DJ Python’s immersive, ebbing instrumentals. A touch of sweetness to hold onto, as a few rays of sunshine are breaking through the clouds...**"**
