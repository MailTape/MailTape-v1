# Let yourself go

Listening to Paul White’s new album is like flying on a magic carpet, it’s a trip. As I listen to his [album](https://paulwhite.bandcamp.com/), my mind gets into a state of flow. Exploring the infinity of the universe, it becomes natural to understand we’re all connected. His music will lead you to what you’re truly looking for in your life, filling that way your mind with soulful inspiration.
