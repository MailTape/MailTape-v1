# Öly's selection

## Melody Gardot – If the Stars Were Mine
_Öly_: **"**What better way to wake up than with Melody Gardot whispering a love song to your ears ? I find in this track the perfect mix between the jazzy music that brings me right back to the summer beaches and the sweetness of here voice to start a beautiful day at a Sunday morning pace.**"**

## Ben Howard – Keep Your Head Up
_Öly_: **"**I listen to this song exclusively with my morning coffee in my hand. The acoustic guitar’s  gimmick gives a good pace to start the day without being too aggressive, I also love the positive lyrics «  Keep your head up, keep your heart strong … »  **"**

## Agnes Obel – Familiar
_Öly_: **"**I love melodies similar to lacework in songs, and when I am surprised by new sound effects, hooks or singularities in voices. Agnès Obel songs always satisfies my ears in succeeding to make them attentive to each element of instrumentation  between her fragile harmonised voices, a structured piano and a beautiful use of strings textures (particularly if it's cellos). In this "Familiar" song, a melancholic and dark universe is described in a unique way with the special use of a "male effect" on her voice. Dreamy trip garanteed.**"**
