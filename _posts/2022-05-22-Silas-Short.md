# Silas Short's selections
## [Whatnauts](https://www.discogs.com/artist/64836-The-Whatnauts) - I’ll Erase Away Your Pain
Silas Short: **"**My first choice Is an oldie by the Whatnauts titled “I’ll erase away your pain”, the song is incredibly rich and full of beautiful arrangement choices with multiple lead vocalists, harp, strings, and accompanied by a very gentle rhythm section. This song is a great song to wake up to because of its beautiful and light mood on such a powerful subject.**"**

## [Bilal](https://bilal.bandcamp.com) - Sometimes
Silas Short: **"**My second choice is a classic beyond classic’s by Bilal titled “Sometimes”. This song has such incredible energy from the jump, it immediately goes from an operatic dreamy intro into one of the heaviest soul pockets I’ve ever heard. This song has such a feel-good mood, that it’s perfect to wake up to on a Sunday morning.**"**

## [Platinum Pied Pipers](https://www.discogs.com/fr/artist/126904-Platinum-Pied-Pipers) - I Got You
Silas Short: **"**Lastly, a song I recently discovered was this hidden classic by the Platinum Pied Pipers titled “I got you” it has the magical early 2000’s balance between produced and played parts, it’s very reminiscent of The RH Factor, with horn arrangements, organ, and Rhodes. It's a super beautiful song to drink.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Silas Short](https://silasshort.bandcamp.com/) - Drawing
ImaCrea: **"**It was super hard to choose a track from his EP (I love them all!), finally I felt "Drawing" was the one which was flowing best to play after Platinum Pied Pipers.**"**

## [Quelle Chris](https://quellechris360.bandcamp.com/album/deathfame) - Alive Ain't Always Living
ImaCrea: **"**What a discovery, a new world opens up here. It's as if I found the successor of MF Doom. Can't wait to dig all his albums.**"**

## [Charles Stepney](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/track/step-on-step) - Step on Step
ImaCrea: **"**Classic good old back to ancient magic mastery.**"**

## [Georgia Anne Muldrow](https://georgiaannemuldrow.bandcamp.com/album/vweto-iii) - Slow Drag
ImaCrea: **"**And who else to finish that selection if not by the queen, Miss Georgia Anne Muldrow!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our warms thanks to [Silas Short](https://silasshort.bandcamp.com/) for his unique selection. Many thanks to Noémie Dijon for her smooth and dreamy illustration!</p>
