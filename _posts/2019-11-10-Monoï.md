# Monoï's selection

## La Luz - Cicada
Monoï: **"**La Luz is an American band founded in 2012 in Seattle.The girly quartet offers a « Black Surf Music », as they call. A raw sound, retro, melodic pop tinged with psychedelism. The track &quot;Cicada&quot;,
is from the album &quot;Floating features&quot; released in May 2018 at Hardly Art Records. A song that combines softness and energy, which makes you want to make a road trip, wind in the hair. Perfect for a Sunday morning ... Its sounds like a Tarantino movie!**"**

## The Limiñanas - Dimanche (Feat Bertrand Belin)
Monoï: **"**Sunday is perfect for the following day
of a drinking Saturday night : it's like a huge coffee we would take on horseback
through the plains, nonchalant, a bit melancholic. Quickly, perfect for
hangovers!**"**

## Mattiel - Je ne me connais pas 
Monoï: **"**Mattiel comes to us from the States!Sunday, connection with the JBL speakers in the bathroom, maximum level,hot water! "Je ne me connais pas" a rock n' roll track a bit wild, inspired by the 60’s, back to basics, useful to go back down by keeping the nostalgia of Saturday night! We remove toxins!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Wilma Vritra - Harness
Jules: **"**[Wilma Vritra](https://wilmavritra.bandcamp.com/) is a trans-atlantic collaboration between Newcastle based artist [Wilma Archer](https://www.facebook.com/WilmaArcherSounds/) and LA based rapper [Pyramid Vritra](https://www.facebook.com/VRITRA322/). This tracks opens 'Burd', their first LP, to me it seemed the perfect song to close this episode and brightly open your day.**"**
