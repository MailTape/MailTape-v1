ennifer : Keyboard/Voice La Luz – Cicada
La Luz is an American band founded in 2012 in Seattle.
The girly quartet offers a « Black Surf Music », as they call.
A raw sound, retro, melodic pop tinged with psychedelism. The track &quot;Cicada&quot;,
is from the album &quot;Floating features&quot; released in May 2018 at Hardly Art
Records. A song that combines softness and energy, which makes you want to
make a road trip, wind in the hair. Perfect for a Sunday morning ... Its sounds
like a Tarantino movie!

Basile, Drums / Lead vocals :
Sunday - The Liminanas / Bertrand Belin Sunday is perfect for the following day
of a drinking Saturday night : it&#39;s like a huge coffee we would take on horseback
through the plains, nonchalant, a bit melancholic. Quickly, perfect for
hangovers!

Alexandre, Guitar:
Mattiel comes to us from the States!
Sunday, connection with the JBL speakers in the bathroom, maximum level,
hot water! &quot;Je ne me connais pas&quot; a rock&#39;n&#39;roll track a bit wild, inspired by the
60’s, back to basics, useful to go back down by keeping the nostalgia of
Saturday night! We remove toxins!
