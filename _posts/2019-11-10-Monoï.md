<p id="introduction"> This morning, we rise up, we jump everywhere, we play tough, we make pogos with our boyfriend. You take your guitar to make the walls shake and piss off the neighbors early in the morning, where you can also play a track from the band [Monoï](https://www.facebook.com/monoii.monoii.monoii/). 
<br><br>
I don't know if [Monoï](https://monoi.bandcamp.com/releases) smells good, but what's certain is that he makes us nervous. This trio, based between Limoges and Poitiers, scour the stages and festivals to make their stoner/psyched music known with big riffs of well-placed and old-fashioned guitars. A group in the making, which still has so much to share with us, to share with us, to follow very closely!

# Monoï's selection

## La Luz - Cicada
Monoï: **"**[La Luz](https://www.facebook.com/laluzusa/) is an American band founded in 2012 in Seattle.The girly quartet offers a « Black Surf Music », as they call. A raw sound, retro, melodic pop tinged with psychedelism. The track "Cicada",is from the album ["Floating features"](https://laluz.bandcamp.com/album/floating-features) released in May 2018 at [Hardly Art Records](https://www.hardlyart.com/). A song that combines softness and energy, which makes you want to make a road trip, wind in the hair. Perfect for a Sunday morning ... Its sounds like a [Tarantino](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino)movie!**"**

## [The Limiñanas](http://www.theliminanas.com/) - Dimanche (Feat [Bertrand Belin](https://www.bertrandbelin.com/))
Monoï: **"**Sunday is perfect for the following day of a drinking Saturday night : it's like a huge coffee we would take on horseback,through the plains, nonchalant, a bit melancholic. Quickly, perfect for hangovers!**"**

## Mattiel - Je ne me connais pas 
Monoï: **"**[Mattiel](https://mattiel.com/) comes to us from the States! Sunday, connection with the JBL speakers in the bathroom, maximum level,hot water! "Je ne me connais pas" a rock n' roll track a bit wild, inspired by the 60’s, back to basics, useful to go back down by keeping the nostalgia of Saturday night! We remove toxins!**"** 


# MailTape's selection

## Monoï - Cinéma Statique
Anaïs G: **"**I met this group on the mini stage of a bar located in Limoges. It seemed rough to me at first, but very quickly I was carried away by this rock fever and the atmosphere of an old cellar where the sweat was perceptible on the spectators faces. A beautiful musical experience, soaked from head to toe!**"**

## Warm Drag - Cave Crawl
Anaïs G: **"**This is the sweet moment of this playlist. [Warm Drag](https://www.facebook.com/warmdrag/), composed of Paul Quattrone (who played in the bands Oh Sees and !!!) and the singer Vashti Windish, offers us a relaxing moment with more synthesis and freshness. So we sit down to catch our breath and let ourselves be carried away by this psychedelic wave.**"**

## Yak - Heaven Aboves
Anaïs G: **"**How to stay out of trouble in front of a group like [Yak](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_(groupe)). Discovered during the [Check In Party](https://www.checkinparty.com/) festival in Gueret at the end of August, I was surprised by the presence on stage and the show of this trio which literally sets fire to us and offers us a nice mess. My devotee jumped on a song from 2016 that didn't appear on their album "Alas Salvation", which nevertheless deserves its place!**"**

## [Peter Kernel](https://peterkernel.bandcamp.com/)  - Panico! This is love
Anaïs G: **"**We end in beauty with a rather explosive Swiss trio that make people talk about them by their music but also by their provocation. "Panico! This is Love" is one of my musical nuggets for letting off steam, full of provocation and emotion, it is just perfect to externalize its bad demons.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Thank you so much for joining us. Much love and respect to [Monoï](https://www.facebook.com/monoii.monoii.monoii/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration. </p>
