<p id="introduction">This morning, VECT selected some dope beats inspiring us a very greeny MailTape. Go with the flow, let your heavy mind evaporates and your body feel the groove. Suddenly, a shaft of sunlight diffracted by a drip of coffee floating in the air opens a door. Let's trip together.</p>

# VECT, a guy who tends to infinity

We're in Toulouse, France. The guy, Emile Sacré, aka [VECT](http://vect.bandcamp.com/), evolves in a multi-dimensional universe. Motiongraphics, design, music, this folk never stop and tries to maintain one common point between all these disciplines : Quality. I remember having discovered him by watching one of his great videos on his Vimeo. Digging in his portfolio I then found the beginning of VECT : beats with a soul. Altitudes, his album, does exactly what says its title. It pushes you to higher states of mind. His compositions are very visually inspired. Each beat morphs into a pixel forming altogether beautiful pictures. Can't wait to listen to his next one.

# Let the trip begins with his selection.

+ ## Knx. - Plaiurpty
_Deluxe_: **"**Here is all I love in a track ! An intense warm feeling mixing R'n'b and soulful, but with a rough touch !**"**

+ ## Mr Carmack - Say Yes Or Say No (Aaliyah Flip)
_Deluxe_: **"**This downtempo remix of Aaliyah is very aerial. Kicks are floating randomly along the track with a subtle bass played off-beat resulting in a high quality production. Something very modern, indeed futuristic.**"**

+ ## Miles Bonny - Clap Clap
_Deluxe_: **"**A dynamic track which offers another way of playing the original track by the The Meters from the 70's. Miles Bonny is singer, producer and jazzist. You can notice a perfect groove coming from the dubbed voice, an acoustic beat and dry guitar riffs.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all for today folks.</p>
