# Bolis Pupul's selection

## [Beck](https://www.beck.com/) - Devil's Haircut
Bolis Pupul: **"**I vividly remember Beck playing “Devils Haircut” in 1997 at T/W festival in Belgium. That’s when I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life (age 11): make music.**"**

## [Armando](https://www.discogs.com/artist/870-Armando) - Don't Take It
Bolis Pupul: **"**A song that would take me straight to the dancefloor. Dave (from DEEWEE/Soulwax/2manydj's) actually introduced me to this track when we were writing "Thank You" off our record - he suggested we'd give it a listen, in particular to how the 303 was used.**"**

## [Prince](https://www.officialprincemusic.com/) - Sign of the Times
Bolis Pupul: **"**In my opinion Prince is the best artist ever. I wish I had written this song myself... just so good.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul](https://charlotteandbolis.com/) - HAHA
Sarah: **"**Off of the debut album, Tropical Dancer. Completely taken with this intricate sampling of Charlotte's laugh; at times sounding like a cry and at others like a cackle. Haunting and humorous all at once. Love the synth work off towards the end, almost dreamlike :)**"**

## [Underground System](https://heavenlysweetness.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-fire-ep) - Desnuda
Sarah: **"**Really enjoying this track off of Underground System's latest EP, Into the Fire (2022). Desnuda was remixed by Yuksek recently, but nothing beats these easy grooves in the original.**"**

## [Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul](https://charlotteandbolis.com/) - It Hit Me
Sarah: **"**Could listen to this track ten times and always find something new to enjoy about the production -- the deadpan vocal samples, the punchy percussives, the deep hitting bass... the track evolves before your ears, whether it's your first or seventh time listening through it.**"**

## [Walter Astral](https://morsels.website/) - L'eau
Sarah: **"**The latest release from Walter Astral. Love the traditional sitar, rock guitar, and synth layering, all these work in surprising harmony together. An interesting listen that builds upon itself, a vibrant finish to this playlist :)**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up this morning's selection! As always, thank you for joining us. Our love to INO hidefumi for his delightful Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's fantastic illustration!</p>
