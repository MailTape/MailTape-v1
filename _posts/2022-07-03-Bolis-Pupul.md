<p id="introduction"> This morning, with a special joy we welcome Tokyo-based jazz and electronic artist [INO hidefumi](https://www.innocentrecord.net/) to MailTape. Known for eclectic tastes and textured sounds, INO's thoughtful selection offers an easy treading into the morning hours.
  <br><br>
[INO hidefumi](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/)'s style stretches from electronic to jazz to ambient music, melding aspects of all these genres in the process. INO joins us following the release of his dark and mellow jazz-electro album, [In Dreams](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/album/in-dreams). This album, like all those before it, was released through his label [Innocent Records](https://innocentrecord.stores.jp/), a pioneer of the **one artist-one label** movement. Through this release and the ones of the past years, INO urges us "Don't Listen, Feel!" embracing a love of music that transcends technicalities or pretension. It's with this attitude that he joins us this morning :)

# INO hidefumi's selection

## [Timmy Thomas](https://www.discogs.com/artist/32166-Timmy-Thomas) - Why Can't We Live Together
Bolis Pupul: **"**I vividly remember Beck playing “Devils Haircut” in 1997 at T/W festival in Belgium. That’s when I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life (age 11): make music.**"**

## [INO hidefumi](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/), [Jean Touitou](https://www.instagram.com/jeantouitou/?hl=en) - It's All Over Now Baby Blue
Bolis Pupul: **"**A song that would take me straight to the dancefloor. Dave (from DEEWEE/Soulwax/2manydj's) actually introduced me to this track when we were writing "Thank You" off our record - he suggested we'd give it a listen, in particular to how the 303 was used.**"**

## [William DeVaughn](https://www.discogs.com/artist/146143-William-DeVaughn) - Be Thankful For What You Got
Bolis Pupul: **"**In my opinion Prince is the best artist ever. I wish I had written this song myself... just so good.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [INO hidefumi](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - IN DREAMS
Sarah: **"**Incredibly difficult work to choose just one song from INO's impressive and extensive discography. This track is the namesake of INO's latest album release. Entranced by the silky texture in this track... Ino's grounded vocals are a wonderful compliment to the jazzy soundscapes Ino creates with such ease. Truly a dream with the Fender Rhodes piano and this magnetic bassline, the track is aptly named :)**"**

## [Will Sprott](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/) - Psychic Lady
Sarah: **"**From one of my favorite [albums](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/album/vortex-numbers) of the moment! The jaunty percussives stretching through this track are beyond delightful, love the folk vocal harmonies swaying alongside each other.**"**

## [Sachiko Kanenobu](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1126272-Sachiko-Kanenobu) - Anata Kara Toku E (Far Away From You)
Sarah: **"**This 1972 track from [Sachiko Kanenobu](https://lightintheattic.net/releases/4903-misora) has such timeless vibrance to it, I had to include it in our morning's selection. Really love these analog psychedelic accents, a wonderful mix.**"**

## [r mccarthy](https://morsels.website/) - Jyoti
Sarah: **"**A healing synth track to close out this playlist of new and found again discoveries :) I could be anywhere and this song would feel like an embrace, I hope it strikes you the same way.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up this morning's selection! As always, thank you for joining us. Our love to INO hidefumi for his delightful Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's fantastic illustration!</p>
