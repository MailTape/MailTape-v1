<p id="introduction"> This morning, let the subtlety of this selection pinch you out of numbness. Our guest [NUMéROBé](https://www.facebook.com/NuMeroBe/ "Numérobé's FB") has gathered a few tunes to wiggle your spine to. Some artists are there to make you forget while others bring you forward, spinning on a carousel, doubting your fulcrums. This French artist's music is reminiscent of a projection of lights, circulating around your shadows, reconnecting the dots, you'll come closer to stillness and enjoy the neutrality. </p>


# **NUMéROBé's selection**

+ ## Seekae - Reset Head 
_NUMéROBé_: **"**I wish I could play this song without getting out of bed, take some time to reset both body and mind.**"**

+ ## Claude Barbara + coucou chloe -  I'll do anything but break dance for ya darling
_NUMéROBé_: **"**A secret cover of a worldwide top hit that everyone sung under the shower on a sunday morning in 2004. Perfect tune to breakdance in the bed with you.**"**

+ ## Hibou Blaster - Musli 
_NUMéROBé_: **"**Looks like it’s sunny outside…maybe not. Time to choose if you get up or keep on doing that mattress dance. Best escape for the upcoming monday.**"**

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## NUMéROBé - Parade 
_PSKY_: **"** I picked that one for it's chaotic stillness, gives me a new appetite for doing more with less.**"**

+ ## Arovane - Tides
_PSKY_: **"** Funny enough, I discovered that song while living on a boat. Tides is an incredibly touching song, a pulsating yet passive symphony.**"**

+ ## Octave Lissner - Wildflower 
_PSKY_: **"** I listened to this song during my morning run, right at the peak of flow, it's uplifting and simple yet vibrates something so magical.**"**

+ ## Afrobombas - De sal e Sol eu sou
_PSKY_: **"** The heat of the sun blasting through the speakers, this beat is wicked and chill . **"**
