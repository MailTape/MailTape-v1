<p id="introduction">This morning, fly off from the Scandinavian Arctic towards space. We head to the mysterious new planet in our solar system. Yet unnamed , I solemnly proposes to name this one in tribute to the man who had perhaps discovered it before anyone else : Hans-Peter Lindstrøm. His work talk about Kingdoms ruled by the ARP-2600 and gods even stronger than Nordic Pantheon. I'm sure he talk about the ninth planet of our solar system.</p>

# To infinity ... and Beyond

King ARP-2600 reign on the great XXX kingdom. XXX, leader of the Glorious Guard, devoted servant of groove and electrical harmony protect the ARP King from sovereign neighbor XXX. Who swear on his connections to bring down his great neighbor. Each Kingdom is, in fact, a planet. In a galaxy far far away, where spaceships are loyal steeds and where battles are won with sound waves, rhythm of days is governed by the bpm of Disco Masters.

As a child who play with his toys, creates universes, stories, heroes, bad guys, Lindstrom make music. He build his own mythology. 

This frail harmony is broken when the princess XXX is kidnapped by the demonic king neighbor XXX. 

# Lindstrøm's spatial selection
 
## Oma & Amberflame - Lazy Sun
Hans-Peter Lindstrøm: **"** Great harp-drenched version of the 2007 AN-2 summertime anthem to extend your summer!**"**

## Michael David - Ohana
H-P L.:**"**Totally awesome balearic spacey 80-s boogie track from Michael David of LA Classixx. Nice bouncy bass and dx-keys!**"**

## Crackazat - Eye Light
Nicholas: **"** Amazing track from a band I know nothing about. Jazz-soul chords with a nice swing makes this a no-brainer**“**
