<p id="introduction">This morning
  <br><br>
  
</p>

# Hélène Barbier's selection

## Carole King- Beautiful
Hélène Barbier: **"**It was hard to choose one Carole King song amongst her entire discography, but this uplifting one is very good for Sunday mornings. This is also the title that was given to The Carole King Musical in 2013.**"**

## Jack Name- Sacred Place
Hélène Barbier: **"**I have never been to California but this song reminds me I want to go.**"**

## Paolo Conte- Sparring Partner
Hélène Barbier: **"**I would hear this song very often at home when I was a child and it stuck with me until now. To this day I still have no idea what the Italian lyrics are about or I keep forgetting but I noticed the word 'memoria' and invented for myself a whole story about getting old and feeling good about it.**"**
