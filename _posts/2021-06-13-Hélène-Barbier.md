<p id="introduction">This morning, the birds are singing, the sun is shining, and can’t shatter our joy of life. To be able to resume a “normal” life, prepare for summer holidays and stroll in the sun. It is with [Hélène Barbier](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/) that we will do all those things indispensable for the survival of all.
  <br><br>
[Hélène Barbier](https://www.facebook.com/hlnbrbr/) transports us with her lunar pop, joyful and melancholic at the same time, even manages to transmit to us “La Peur”, a title featured on the album “Régulus”, which is due to be released on June 18th under the label [Michel Records](https://michelrecords.bandcamp.com/) and [Celluloïd Lunch](Celluloïd Lunch).</p>

# Hélène Barbier's selection

## [Carole King](https://www.caroleking.com/)- Beautiful
Hélène Barbier: **"**It was hard to choose one Carole King song amongst her entire discography, but this uplifting one is very good for Sunday mornings. This is also the title that was given to The Carole King Musical in 2013.**"**

## Jack Name- Sacred Place
Hélène Barbier: **"**I have never been to California but this song reminds me I want to go.**"**

## [Paolo Conte](https://www.facebook.com/paoloconteofficial)- Sparring Partner
Hélène Barbier: **"**I would hear this song very often at home when I was a child and it stuck with me until now. To this day I still have no idea what the Italian lyrics are about or I keep forgetting but I noticed the word 'memoria' and invented for myself a whole story about getting old and feeling good about it.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Hélène Barbier](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/)  – La Peur 
Anaïs G: **"**It was while listening to this song that I discovered Hélène Barbier. Pop music that comforts us and plunges us into a chill atmosphere in the city for the summer. The perfect track, simple and effective!**"**

## [Omni](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/)  – Sincerely Yours
Anaïs G: **"**This trio from Atlanta dazzled me during the Hop Hop Festival in Orleans. A nice meeting in interview and discovery on stage, which made me like their post-punk music. I loved their “[Multi-Task](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/album/multi-task)” album but I fell in love listening to their “[Networker](https://omniatl.bandcamp.com/album/networker)” EP and more specifically “Sincerely Yours”, which lays the groundwork.**"**

## [François Virot](https://soundcloud.com/francoisvirot) – Cascade Kisses
Anaïs G: **"**The music of François Virot, it is a bit as if our emotions had been shaking at the shaker. We go from crazy energy to a slow ambiance passing by an indescribable joy against a background of nostalgia that warms the heart. We listen to this song by the fire, with friends, one guitar in hand and one bottle in the other, in moderation.**"**

## [Phern](https://phern.bandcamp.com/) – I Sold The House
Anaïs G: **"**And we end with a touch of originality with the Montreal band, Phern. A psyche track, released on the EP “[Pause Clope](https://phern.bandcamp.com/album/pause-clope-2)”, under the label [Fixture Records](https://fixturerecords.bandcamp.com/), that puts a smile on our face for this weekend.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for listening with us. So much love to [Hélène Barbier](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/) for the delightful Sunday selections and to [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/)for this episode's brilliant illustration :)</p>
