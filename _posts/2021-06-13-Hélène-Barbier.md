# MailTape's selection

## [The Growth Eternal](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/)  – VII. Ghalani
Sarah: **"**Looking over his albums, Byron feels special closeness to this track from Bass Tone Paintings. As he explains, the name _Byron_ translates to _barnyard_ in old English, which is _Ghalani_ in Swahili. The song speaks to the power of language in our reality and its deep entanglement with history. The chant in the second part of the song follows a Buddhist mantra structure, repeating over and over again "I've only known my name in the colonial tongue, but they gave me a name in the colonial tongue, now I know myself through the colonial tongue."**"**

## [Nailah Hunter](https://nailahhunter.bandcamp.com/) – Talk Show Host
Sarah: **"**So enchanted by Nailah Hunter's latest EP, Quietude. As always, her vocals are silky and set perfectly against the harp's melodies. Stunning vocal harmonies build toward the end, an entire space is created :)"**"**

## [Wau Wau Collectif](https://wauwaucollectif.bandcamp.com/album/yaral-sa-doom) – Mouhamodou Lo and His Children
Sarah: **"**So much levity in this Senegalese track, despite the steady jazz rhythm and deep grounding lead vocals. I love the childrens' voices, and the carries of light synth that lace throughout the track. Somehow, there's also a hint of classic folk music in the light melodies :) The entire album is a wonderful listen from front to back, cannot recommend enough.**"**

## [Sam Gendel](https://samgendel.bandcamp.com/album/satin-doll) – Goodbye Pork Pie Hat
Sarah: **"**When describing his grounding in jazz, Byron describes how, upon hearing a magical arrangement of Ellington's In A Sentimental Mood, he fell deeply in love with music, and has not looked back since then. I was reminded of Sam Gendel's Satin Doll album (2020), where Gendel evolves many jazz standards with an experimental sweep. Hearing Mingus' classic revised in this nearly psychedelic manner is such a fantastic reminder of the versatility of music and the many exciting fusion projects to come.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for listening with us. So much love to [The Eternal Growth](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/) for the delightful Sunday selections and to [Noémie Dijon](https://vimeo.com/noemiedijon) for this episode's brilliant illustration :)</p>

Carole King- Beautiful : Carole King - Beautiful (Official Audio)
It was hard to choose one Carole King song amongst her entire discography, but this uplifting one is very good for Sunday mornings. This is also the title that was given to The Carole King Musical in 2013.

Jack Name- Sacred Place: Jack Name - Sacred Place (Official Video)
I have never been to California but this song reminds me I want to go.

Paolo Conte- Sparring Partner: Sparring Partner
I would hear this song very often at home when I was a child and it stuck with me until now. To this day I still have no idea what the Italian lyrics are about or I keep forgetting but I noticed the word 'memoria' and invented for myself a whole story about getting old and feeling good about it.
