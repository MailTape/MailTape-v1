<p id="introduction">This morning, we are pleased to welcome [Marc Desse](https://www.instagram.com/marc.desse/) to select three Sunday morning songs. 

Marc Desse, a French singer and musician, mixes hedonist texts with a laid-back style, creating spontaneously a warm and languid sound. If you listen carefully, you should be able to detect pretty easily some influences from bands like Aline or Taxi Girl.

His last luminous songs promise an energizing and romantic album (coming soon). An album that we imagine as a declaration of love for the city, with a new track titled "Paris je t'aime" to be released in the next few days.

# Marc Desse's selection

## Frànçois Atlas & Juliette Armanet - L'invitation au voyage
Marc Desse: **"**A good Sunday morning starts smoothly. That's why I picked the song "L'invitation au voyage" from Baudelaire's _Les Fleurs du Mal _and set to music by Frànçois Atlas in 2018 in the form of an album with eight other poems. For me, L'invitation au voyage is one of the most beautiful duets of the last few years. The music really blows you away and the two voices blend together wonderfully.**"**

## Faux Real - Boss Sweet

Marc Desse: **"**Sunday morning is also the time to remember the evening before and the songs you liked to dance to or just listen to. One track that's been coming up a lot lately is Boss Sweet from the Franco-American band Faux Real, which I think is really perfect. It's a real hit for me, especially the chorus and its catchy melody.**"**

## Tutto va bene quando facciamo l'amore - Alex Rossi feat. Jo Wedin
Marc Desse: **"**The time comes when you have to get up and find some energy to enjoy your Sunday. That's why I'm putting Alex Rossi's new album and his italo-disco hit Tutto Va Bene Quando Facciamo L'Amore at full volume in my living room which makes me happy and motivates me to go and find a spot under the sun in good company.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Marc Desse](https://www.instagram.com/marc.desse/) – On s'aime
Marion: **"**To start summer properly, I recommend that you listen to this song that can increase the atmosphere of any street by 5 degrees with a big cocktail and a large fan in front of you. Like a big warm hug blurring the sunny lanes.**"**

## [Sam Valdez](https://samvaldezsounds.bandcamp.com/) – Toothache
Marion: **"**If you are familiar with Mazzy Star's mood, you should immediately feel attracted by Sam Valdez's voice. She's riding the same waves, with the same intensity.**"**

## [Laura Marling](https://lauramarling.bandcamp.com/) – Song For Our Daughter
Marion: **"**Listening to Laura Marling over the years has been like listening to her own life evolution. Starting as a small indie voice playing the ukulele, she has never stopped growing. Her latest album is like a climax, but always delicate and subtle.**"**

## [Cass McCombs & Steve Gunn](https://cassmccombs.bandcamp.com/) – Sweet Lucy
Marion: **"**What is better than a naive and catchy melody to complete your waking up in the morning and start brewing your coffee? It's up to you.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Thank you so much for joining us. Much love to Marc Desse for his  selection, and to [Noemie Dijon](https://noemiedijon.tumblr.com/) for this episode's beautiful illustration.</p>
