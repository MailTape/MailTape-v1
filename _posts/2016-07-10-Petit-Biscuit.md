<p id="introduction">This morning, we bring you the soundtrack to summer's daydreams. [Petit Biscuit](https://www.facebook.com/petitbiscuitsound/ "Petit Biscuit's Facebook") is reminiscent of that glimpse of sunlight projected onto your favorite building at the end of the day. Something special, a contemplative melody powered by the genuine desire to create and share.</p>

# Fondamental purity

Confession: my inspiration has been more than sparse lately, the longing for belonging, for feeling and sensing the every moments of living, for creating and sharing, the well was dry and I couldn’t find the source of wealth, like it was lost in the mist of over reflection and too much action. But then I heard "Sunset Lover" and it dawned on me, like a silk veil, protecting me from the wolf of depression.
**Petit Biscuit**, as his name holds it, brings us something so simple, so pure, so raw and yet so mature and grounded. It’s genuine intention of sharing the goodness of sound is piercing and moving. I was left floating like a pink balloon contemplated from afar by a child’s mesmerized gaze.

The rest of this MailTape is packed with some serious surprises powered by taste and dare. We come from France, we dance, we’re talented and we’ll make your Sunday a field to play and jam the pain away.

# Petit Biscuit's selection:

## Day Wave - Drag : 

_Petit Biscuit_: This track just makes me wanna go out of my bed and enjoy my life, but also makes me think of holidays, summer, friends, love, lot of the most beautiful things in this world.

## Mura Masa - ...Girls

_Petit Biscuit_: This one makes me wanna chill with a big cup of coffee.


## Flume - Take A Chance (ft. Little Dragon) 

_Petit Biscuit_: I just bought the limited vinyl edition. And all the tracks his album are absolutely incredible, this one puts me definitely in a good mood, to wake me up with a big smile.
