# mofo title

let's have a first paragraph here
 
# Douchka's selection:

## Salute - You Owe Me

Douchka: **"**Synthesizers are super warm and bring a really amazing groove on this track. The voice is really beautiful and also somewhat reminiscent of the beginnings of Franck Ocean of whom I'm a fan. I also had the opportunity to play after Salute at The Sound You Need's Festival in Paris, he really made the best set of that night for me.**"**

## Unno - Blue Leaf

Douchka: **"**Unno is a recent signing of my label Nowadays Records. They perfectly combine hyper sounds worked to simple and effective melodies. The texture of their songs makes me think of a cross between James Blake, Chet Faker and Breton. It sounds very Anglo-Saxon for me.
This is a special group within the French music scene, and it's very refreshing.**"**

## JIL - Emotional Heat

Douchka: **"**It's a big discovery for me lately. I came across it by chance on soundcloud. I love the smooth and rnb of this track which remains at the same time very effective in clubs. I currently closed my DJ sets with this title.**"**
