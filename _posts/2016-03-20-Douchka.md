<p id="introduction">This morning, our great guest [Douchka](https://www.facebook.com/douchkamusic/) initiated this selection with smooth and positive energy. Building on that, I pumped it with crispy sounds and pushy drums. We couldn't dream of a better guest to celebrate spring.</p>

# Adios winter!

Winter wasn't an easy one, France will never forget its unfortunate people shot in 2015 terrible events. With spring starting comes a new hope in more openness and love in the world. Music has the potential to change our minds and make
 us better, through dance we get to know ourselves and others without any barriers. 

Supported by our friends at Nowadays Records, Douchka shares an inspiration coming from his deepest feelings. Pushing the boundaries of the French electronic scene, his dripping beats smells like the wind of nature renaissance.
 
# Douchka's selection:

## Salute - You Owe Me

Douchka: **"**Synthesizers are super warm and bring a really amazing groove on this track. The voice is really beautiful and also somewhat reminiscent of the beginnings of Franck Ocean of whom I'm a fan. I also had the opportunity to play after Salute at The Sound You Need's Festival in Paris, he really made the best set of that night for me.**"**

## Unno - Blue Leaf

Douchka: **"**Unno is a recent signing of my label Nowadays Records. They perfectly combine hyper sounds worked to simple and effective melodies. The texture of their songs makes me think of a cross between James Blake, Chet Faker and Breton. It sounds very Anglo-Saxon for me.
This is a special group within the French music scene, and it's very refreshing.**"**

## JIL - Emotional Heat

Douchka: **"**It's a big discovery for me lately. I came across it by chance on soundcloud. I love the smooth and rnb of this track which remains at the same time very effective in clubs. I currently closed my DJ sets with this title.**"**
