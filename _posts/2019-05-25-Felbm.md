# Felbm's selection

##  Aquarius - Europanema
_Felbm_: **"**Sundays are generally perfect for bossa nova music and this not so widely known group had their own trademark of adding Beach Boys-like harmonies to the more traditional unison singing. This song was written (and the album was co-produced) by Burnier, which can be heard in the composition as well as in the arrangement that resemble his work with Burnier & Cartier from the same period, that I’m also a fan of because of the sound and the rich harmonies. Apart from that for me personally this type of close-harmony singing reminds me of Sundays at home when I was younger and my dad would play Take 6 recordings in the living room quite loudly.**"**

## Eberhard Weber - Bird Out Of Cage
_Felbm_: **"**First track off the very nice and Sunday-suitable album “Pendulum” by German bass player Eberhard Weber. It’s a recording made with just bass guitar and effects but that rises beyond a “bass record”, as it moves somewhere between jazz, fusion, minimal and ambient music. I like how his melodious bass playing actually sounds like a voice that is singing or speaking to you, while the background is quite meditative. This album also reminds me of the early Henri Texier albums that are bass-driven yet have the same meditative/spiritual quality.**"**

## Rogier van Otterloo - Moord Met Geduld
_Felbm_: **"**This is a song taken from the original soundtrack of the Dutch classic movie Turks Fruit. The title track - with the magnificent whistling and guitar playing by Toots Thielemans - is best known, but the whole album is a perfect Sunday record. This track is a great example of the brilliant work of composer and arranger Rogier van Otterloo. He was a star in creating these softly played romantic songs with warm string arrangements. I’m just a total sucker for the sound of this recording, with the crispy rhodes on top of the subdued playing of the rhythm section.**"**
