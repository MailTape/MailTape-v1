The Knife, "From Off to on"
I found out about the knife when i was very young, they probably helped me to define the vision i have of music, especially electronic music. I like the idea that beyond the musical aspect, they have this strong graphic universe. Thanks to that, they never engaged into hyped things and they never enclosed themselves in a precise style while keeping it really consistent.

Oneohtrix Point Never, "Lost but never alone"
I really love this producer’s protean approaches which can easily go from very melodic productions to flights of subtle experimentations. His album Magic Oneohtrix Point Never was a slap in 2020. There again, it’s something that goes beyond musical production, it’s really intense with sometimes tortured and roughly handled sonorities but the result is always beyond hopes or expectations, as if he always was one step ahead.

Roches Noires, " Breathin' "
Breathin’ is from Roches noires’ first EP, « Made To Disappear », he’s a friend who produces music and he’s developping a cold and sophosticatec electronica project. I listen to his works a lot right now because we work on something together. I cannot say too much about it because it’s still confidential… to be continued !
