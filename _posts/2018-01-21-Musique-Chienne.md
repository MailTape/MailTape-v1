# Musique Chienne's selection

## Klaus Johann Grobe - Geschichten aus erster Hand
_Musique Chienne_: **"**A Swiss friend sent me this song in December, the band is Swiss German. I listen to this track kind of all the time, I try to share it as much as I can, I even played it twice on New Year’s Eve. I love the flute part, and the small recurring synth notes. You need to watch the video, the singer is very funny.<br>
“I did not know that Swiss Germans were so funny”**"**

## WORLD BRAIN - Made U Cry
_Musique Chienne_: **"**Made U Cry is the new track of World Brain, a friend that’s part of the German band [Fenster](https://www.facebook.com/fenstermusic/) (I could have also chosen one of their tracks by the way). Lucas can sings lower notes as well as high notes very well, it’s a beautiful performance live, I had the opportunity to play live with him recently. This music evokes Ariel Pink to me, that I also love a lot.<br>
“We both have long blond ears”**"**

## Mammane Sani et son Orgue - Bodo (Anatolian Weapons Rework)
_Musique Chienne_: **"**I rediscovered his music during a sunny gig at [La Station](https://www.facebook.com/stationgaredesmines/) in Paris. It was very moving. His music tells a lot of stories, even though there are very few lyrics. The track I’ve chosen is a remix that I find very good.<br>
“Music of a sun that was born with rhythm”**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Musique Chienne - Gâteau aux oiseaux
_Inès_: **"**This is the track I discovered Musique Chienne with, and is still my favorite of hers. Her music is super refreshing. It has this kind of unapologetic naivety that is not found in lots of songs, as if you were part of a cartoon. This one in particular makes me instantly hyper happy, much like the rest of her releases.**"**

## Waterfall Person - I Wanna Go To The Dog Park See All My Friends
_Inès_: **"**Cotton-candy tasting music. A concentrate of sweet sweet innocence, glittery little synth notes, pastel-feeling made-up scenario. Cuteness at its finest!**"**

## Tainsus - Can't make sense of it all, can you?
_Inès_: **"**Tainsus is one of my accidental SoundCloud discoveries. He makes synth-based tunes, and this one is my favorite of his. No need for lyrics when you have that title and build-up/release combination. So, so comforting when you need to get your head out of something, find peace for a few minutes, or just breathe.**"**

## OH MU - TOUT LE MONDE EST CONTENT ET VA À SA MAISON
_Inès_: **"**Wins first place in "best title" category (it translates to "EVERYBODY IS HAPPY AND IS GOING BACK TO THEIR HOUSE"). A fun, nice and carefree little sitcomy instrumental track to get on with your day!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks for listening! A warm thank you to [Musique Chienne](https://www.facebook.com/musiquechienne/) for being our guest this morning, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's illustration. Have a bright Sunday!</p>
