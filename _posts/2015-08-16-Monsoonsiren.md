<p id="introduction">This Sunday, we bring you a breath of fresh air with a young and rejuvenating artist from India. Nathan Menon is a vibrant and budding artist who goes by the name of [Monsoonsiren](https://soundcloud.com/monsoonsiren). His minimalist vocals are both spacey and captivating, combining a style of easy-going percussions flowing slowly through your veins.</p>

[Monsoonsiren](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Monsoonsiren/333811626735137) is an eclectic and interesting artist with a taste palate that will make you wonder if it ever snows in the summer. Starting off with a track that, although a bit strange at first, quickly unleashes an ingeniosity that is unique and dreamy. Sunday is just beginning and this song will replace the missing chants of the spring birds should you need an enticing reason to wander out of bed.. Kanye West! What else to say? Risk-takers don’t exist for nothing. Stetson is a touching discovery, releasing a constellation of tickling vibes down your spine. ‘’Among the sef’’ is magical, heartrending with sincerity and force. 

One may wonder how can an untitled track resonate such soulful and deep vibes? 
Monsoonsiren tempts us with his lustful voice and gives us a glimpse of his pulsating talent. 

Forget the basics, mumbles “can” be interpreted, especially with hints of love and you, two words that will make anything vague clearly meaningful. From mumbles to the boogie, it’s all good honey!!! Just hang-on to that favorite number of yours cause I am gonna leave you anyway. I don’t need you no more, no more, I have music to keep me company......

# Monsoonsiren's inspiring selection :

## Nathan Johnson - Emelys Theme (Brick OST)
Monsoonsiren: **"**I love the Brick OST and someone has been kind enough to compile each of the pieces on Soundcloud. This is music to lay in bed to whilst you stare at the ceiling, mimicking the finesse Jef Costello possesses.**"**

## Kanye West - Monster (Teachers remix)
Monsoonsiren: **"**Such a unique take on one of my favorite Kanye tracks.**"**

## Colin Stetson - Among the sef
Monsoonsiren:**"**I can't quite articulate precisely how this piece makes me feel. To call it cathartic would be a cliche.**"**
