	This morning, we're embarking on a dreamy journey with [Adela Mede](https://adelamede.bandcamp.com/album/szabads-g-3). Her carefully selected tracks take us deep into a smooth and blissful soundscape, allowing us to wake up gently while keeping the dream alive throughout the day. Join us now, and let's set sail on this tranquil musical adventure.

# Adela Mede's selection

## [Martyna Basta](https://martynabasta.bandcamp.com/album/slowly-forgetting-barely-remembering) - Slowly Forgetting, Barely Remembering

Adela Mede: **"**The repetitive motif represents goodness, warmness and gentleness for me. It's music you want near your heart, and certainly to start your day with. Martyna really knows how to work with subconscious thoughts floating and fluttering around. This entire album is a gem and I think I will be returning to it for years on end. Martyna is also a very dear friend and a collaborator, and I feel very lucky I get to work with such incredible musicians.**"**


## [Ani Zakareishvili](https://warmwintersltd.bandcamp.com/album/fallin) - Answer

Adela Mede: **"**A beautiful collage of enamored samples. I am a huge fan of Ani's work for many reasons. There is a certain playfulness, kind of like a cheeky smile in her music which really uplifts my spirits. This playfulness can be heard on her debut album "Mtirala", as well as her latest release "Fallin", of which I chose the last track. I love the combination of the piano sample and the beautiful synth which kind of sounds like an angelic choir. **"**

## [HVAD & Pan Daijing](https://p-a-n.bandcamp.com/album/v-a-mono-no-aware) - Zhao Hua

Adela Mede: **"**A moment of pure happy bliss. A bit less of a recent release, but I had the honour of hearing this track played live in Bratislava, in the main hall of the Technical University here. It was magical. I think sometimes I find it hard to connect to ambient music because I lack some sort of a feeling. With this track it's so simple, not too many layers, the perfect chord progression. I would say it's something to either start OR end your day with. It's hard to not feel gratitude when listening to this track. Not to mention, "Zhao Hua" translates to "to blossom", which beautifully aligns with the themes I try to explore in my own music.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Adela Mede](https://adelamede.bandcamp.com/album/szabads-g-3) - Spolu

ImaCrea: **"**Adela Mede's work on this title seems quite representative of her debut album released last year: [Szabadság](https://adelamede.bandcamp.com/album/szabads-g-3). It features a layered music that attempts to reconcile the cultures that make it up: Hungarian, Slovak, and English. At times, there is a certain dissonance that reflects the moments of internal questioning we go through in life. It's a poetic and electronic sound that touches me deeply. An artist to watch without a doubt.**"**

## [Flaty](https://gostzvuk.bandcamp.com/track/a1-u-c-2) - U C

ImaCrea: **"**This voice that sounds like it's on helium takes us up a notch, to the top of the atmosphere. We ascend with humor and joy thanks to these sounds that seem to come from another world.**"**

## [Donato Dozzy & Sabla](https://gangofducks.bandcamp.com/album/crono) - Flusso IV

ImaCrea: **"**Let's spread our wings and soar with this newly released sound that has come out just a few days ago. As we listen, we see the landscapes pass by leisurely, while our minds rise and fall with the ebb and flow of the sound waves. We feel the currents of ascent and descent that are embedded in the sonic vibrations, lifting us up and carrying us forward on a blissful flight.**"**


## [PVAS](https://isla.bandcamp.com/album/somaesthesia) - Dream Resumption ft. PS

ImaCrea: **"**As we touch down, our bodies re-ground to the surface of the planet. We feel the pulsations of nature all around us, and our own vibrations align in perfect harmony with the rhythms of the Earth. Let's wake up and dance.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today! Thanks for being with us dear folks. Thanks a lot to [Adela Mede](https://adelamede.bandcamp.com) for her blissful selection. And bravo to Celestin for this touching illustration. See you next Sunday.</p>
