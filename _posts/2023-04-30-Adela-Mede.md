# Adela Mede's selection

## Martyna Basta - Slowly Forgetting, Barely Remembering

Adela Mede: **"**The repetitive motif represents goodness, warmness and gentleness for me. It's music you want near your heart, and certainly to start your day with. Martyna really knows how to work with subconscious thoughts floating and fluttering around. This entire album is a gem and I think I will be returning to it for years on end. Martyna is also a very dear friend and a collaborator, and I feel very lucky I get to work with such incredible musicians.**"**


## Ani Zakareishvili - Answer

Adela Mede: **"**A beautiful collage of enamored samples. I am a huge fan of Ani's work for many reasons. There is a certain playfulness, kind of like a cheeky smile in her music which really uplifts my spirits. This playfulness can be heard on her debut album "Mtirala", as well as her latest release "Fallin", of which I chose the last track. I love the combination of the piano sample and the beautiful synth which kind of sounds like an angelic choir. **"**

## HVAD & Pan Daijing - Zhao Hua

Adela Mede: **"**A moment of pure happy bliss. A bit less of a recent release, but I had the honour of hearing this track played live in Bratislava, in the main hall of the Technical University here. It was magical. I think sometimes I find it hard to connect to ambient music because I lack some sort of a feeling. With this track it's so simple, not too many layers, the perfect chord progression. I would say it's something to either start OR end your day with. It's hard to not feel gratitude when listening to this track. Not to mention, "Zhao Hua" translates to "to blossom", which beautifully aligns with the themes I try to explore in my own music.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for this Sunday morning! Thanks for being with us. Much love to [Martin Dupont](https://martindupont.bandcamp.com) and particularly Alain Seghir for his eclectic selection of gems which greatly inspired me. And what else to say about this great work of art by Meriam for the illustration. See you next Sunday morning.</p>
