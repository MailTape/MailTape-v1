This morning, wake up with a soulful selection inspired by monsieur [Blitz The Ambassador](http://blitz.mvmt.com/ "Blitz The Ambassador"). Starting with a classic sampled all over the hip-hop universe and finishing with some rough deep jazz, each track reveals a new surprise. Some may say we’re going into circle, to them we say it’s a spiral and this episode is to remind them we’ll keep digging the best to wake you up every sunday with a big smile on your face.</p>

# Africa is the Future

Buying a ticket to explore Africa, this is what you may want to do after having listened to **Afropolitan Dreams**, the new much awaited album of [Blitz The Ambassador](http://blitz.mvmt.com/ "Blitz The Ambassador") (release date april 28th). Mixing poetry, afrobeat, hip-hop with a stunning flow and featuring Oxmo Puccino, Seun Kuti, Angelique Kidjo and Nneka, his music lighted a big green YES in my mind. Truly motivated to make a change, he’ll do everything he can to show you Africa is the future. As he sings _"Never in the game for the glory, just a kid from Africa, here to tell my story, and all I had was a dollar and a dream"_.

# His morning inspiration

## Bob James - Nautilus
BTA: **"**Bob James is an absolute master of subtle grooves. This song exemplifies his style. But the break and bass line are what I adore the most. No wonder so many classic Hip-Hop records sampled this song. My favorite being Ghostface Killah Daytona 500.**"**

## Electric Wire Hustle - Waters
BTA: **"**Electric Wire Hustle are an incredible discovery for me. No one expects guys from New Zealand to have to much soul. This is one song I can keep on repeat. They have mastered that off-beat snare sound that makes your neck snap. Perfect chill sunday music**"**

## dj100 Proof - Happy Mentality
BTA: **"**I love blends. That's practically my entire style of production, so when I hear a great blend I can't help but loose it. This one is especially great because Fela is one of my favorite artists and Pharell is one of my favorite songwriter and producers. So bringing them together just works like magic.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to [Blitz The Ambassador](http://blitz.mvmt.com/ "Blitz The Ambassador") for his selection. Thanks for listening and enjoy your sunday!
