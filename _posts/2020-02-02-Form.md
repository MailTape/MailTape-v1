# Form's selection

##  Moses Sumney - Quarrel
_Form_: **"**A breath of fresh air.This song has been very close to our hearts since it got out.
Moses’ voice, the arrangement and mixing of this song are just absolute beauty. We were together the first time listened to it, and it just had a very powerful impact on the 3 of us.**"**

##  La Chica - Addict
_Form_: **"**La Chica’s universe is just an unbelievable balance between her 2 cultures (France-Venezuela) and her album is amazing.This song shows perfectly how good of a songwriter she is.The warm sound of the piano and her voice just give us chills everytime we listen to it.**"**

##  Weval - Are you even real
_Form_: **"**We’ve been obsessed with this song also.
Masters of arrangement, the mixing is a beauty and the evolution of this song is one of the best we’ve heard in a while!Very deep and touching song. **"**
