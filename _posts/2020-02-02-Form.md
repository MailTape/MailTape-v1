<p id="introduction">This morning, we need oxygen and wide open spaces. To breathe the fresh air, to be as close as possible to nature and to let the wind carry you over the mountains. By mixing music and nature, our movements are in harmony, creating a succession of forms reminiscent of contemporary dance...
<br><br>
[Form](https://www.facebook.com/akousmaticform/) is a bit like a choreography of notes, one after the other. The mix of electronic and pop music creates a perfect symbiosis that transports us into several universes or trance-like dance-like worlds. Intense!
<br><br></p>


# Form's selection

##  [Moses Sumney](https://www.mosessumney.com/) - Quarrel
_Form_: **"**A breath of fresh air.This song has been very close to our hearts since it got out. Moses’ voice, the arrangement and mixing of this song are just absolute beauty. We were together the first time listened to it, and it just had a very powerful impact on the 3 of us.**"**

##  [La Chica](https://www.facebook.com/LaChicaBelleville/) - Addict
_Form_: **"**La Chica’s universe is just an unbelievable balance between her 2 cultures (France-Venezuela) and her album is amazing. This song shows perfectly how good of a songwriter she is. The warm sound of the piano and her voice just give us chills everytime we listen to it.**"**

##  [Weval](https://weval.net/) - Are You Even Real
_Form_: **"**We’ve been obsessed with this song also. Masters of arrangement, the mixing is a beauty and the evolution of this song is one of the best we’ve heard in a while! Very deep and touching song.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Form](https://soundcloud.com/formtouch) – Trigger
_Anaïs G_: **"**Groove, style and meaning, that's what impressed me when I listened to their music. "Trigger" from their second EP "CWT" gathers all their criteria with an incredible power rise. Special mention for the clip that highlights the deviant behaviour of some in our society.**"**

## [Gyles Bartle](http://www.gylesbartle.co.uk/) – You
_Anaïs G_: **"**It's hard to define Gyles Bartle's music and the feeling that comes out of it when you listen to his music. And yet this young electro producer and rapper plunges us into a second state with his track "You" taken from his EP "[96](https://soundcloud.com/gylesbartle/sets/96-20)" released in 2018. A moment of floating, something very urban with an incredible detachment as if we were out of our bodies.**"**

## [David Douglas](https://www.facebook.com/musicdaviddouglas/) – California Poppy
_Anaïs G_: **"**It was while talking with this morning's illustrator and my friend [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/), that I discovered David Douglas. It's with his album "[Moon Observations](https://soundcloud.com/daviddouglasmusic/sets/david-douglas-moon-observations-atomnation)" that this Dutch DJ seduced me with tracks like "Higher" or "You" that I selected for this playlist. A musical jewel that transports us to a lunar atmosphere!**"**

## [Yu Su](https://soundcloud.com/yu_su) – Watermelon Woman
_Anaïs G_: **"**Cosmic and organic, this cover of Herbie Hancock's "Watermelon Man" by Yu Su, puts us in a psychedelic trance, which promises us a perched Sunday!**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love and respect to  for their Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://www.instagram.com/bravocamo/) for her brilliant illustration!</p>
