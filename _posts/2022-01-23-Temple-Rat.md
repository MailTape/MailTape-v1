<p id="introduction"> This morning, we wake up with some grooves with [Temple Rat](https://www.instagram.com/meiyuxinmay).
<br><br>
IMei, who started producing and performing music under her moniker Temple Rat in 2015, grew up near the vibrant megacity of Chengdu. At the age of 9, she began to learn the traditional Chinese Erhu, a mysterious two-stringed folk instrument made from carved wood and snakeskin, played with a bow. Through her years in Chengdu Mei was inspired by her passion for the city’s hyped underground electronic music scene and eventually started to fuse traditional Chinese folk music with minimalistic techno tunes.
 Today with Mei’s groovy selection, we cast away the misty, chilly air for a moment, and step inside the warm greenery that’s filled by a nostalgic sunbeam.

# u.r.trax's selection

## Unklevon - Sharping Shadow
u.r.trax: **"**Unklevon is a French producer I really admire. He has the secret to make classy yet energetic electro bangers. Often, he adds a bit of his voice and it always works ! Lately, I've been opening my sets a lot with this track : very sexy and versatile. It oscillates between uplifting pads, impactant vocals and a very straightforward beat.**"**

## Eartheater, Tony Seltzer - Joyride
u.r.trax: **"**Eartheater is a siren whispering to your ear. This artist's sonic range sweeps from ambient to trap and hyperpop. Her singing is so particular, and becomes even more magical when blended to futuristic productions. I've been obsessed with Joyride ever since it came out. Her voice makes me feel so many things !**"**

## Sentimental Rave - Unreleased Love
u.r.trax: **"**Sentimental Rave is maybe the artist with the purest soul i've ever met. First time I heard her live, she finished her set with one of her productions and I cried (lol). Her work on textures, rhythms, and her production methods are really impressive. But, the most amazing thing is how she sends pure emotion the second you listen to her tracks. The melody in this track almost reminds me of classical music !**"**


# MailTape's selection

## u.r.trax - Race Against The Time
Jules: **"**Taken from u.r.trax's new EP ["U R TRA$H"](https://lobstertheremin.com/album/u-r-tra-h), released in September 2021 on the London-based label Lobster Theremin, this track, with its complex beat and its metallic and distressing synths, represents well the precocity, the desire and the urgency embodied by the music of the young Parisian producer. Maybe a little too hard for a Sunday morning, but do we still have time anyway?**"**

## [Simo Cell](https://simocell.bandcamp.com/) - Whispers
Jules: **"**This track is an extract of the album "YES.DJ" released in September 2021. This album, published on Simo Cell's own label TEMƎT, is another celebration of dance music, dancefloors and DJing. While the clubs are once again closed, the concerts canceled and the artists in uncertainty, the French DJ/producer makes us explore here different styles of beats. Time to think of your new dance moves fro 2022.**"**

## [Bambounou](https://bambounouofficial.bandcamp.com/) - Final Conference
Jules: **"**2021 has been an important year for the Parisian DJ and producer Bambounou, with the launch of his new label Bambe. The first releases with imprints of ambient and tribal sounds, as well as the aesthetic of the label, represent well the new mature and resolutely modern space wanted by Bambounou, and impressed and inspired me a lot this year.**"**

## Asna - Atalaku
Jules: **"**Last (but not least) of my great discoveries of last year, this track released on the label ["BLANC MANIOC"](https://blancmanioclabel.bandcamp.com/track/atalaku), a label exclusively dedicated to modern African electronic music which turned my head and my body up and down.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to u.r.trax for her energizing Sunday selections, and many thanks to Meriam Kherbat for this episode's stunning illustration !</p>
