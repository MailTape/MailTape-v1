# The art of sampling.

[Degiheugi](https://www.facebook.com/degiheugi) is one these humble artists one generally finds by chance. Not so much inclined in any promotion, they focus solely on mastering their art.

And our man is not a beginner, with a few albums released, he’s buildind a solid monument of trip-hop with an incredible collection of samples. With the style of a great artist like Gaudí, his imagination is unstoppable.

His secret weapon ? Transcending samples to another level by not solely using them for their vibes but also for their lyrics, he manages to break the frontiers of trip-hop and create a new world of wonder.

# Degiheugi's inspiring selection :
 
## Jorge Ben Jor - Oba, la vem ela
Degiheugi: **"**This is a typical Sunday morning track for me... the cool stuff that always put a smile on your face. Even on hangover, you'll wanna dance. More than that, I've been digging 70's brazilian music for the last 2-3 years, it's like a sun ray shining in your living room, a kind of happiness drug.**"**

## RJD2 - Reminder
Degiheugi:**"**This track comes from the album RJD2 produced in collaboration with STS. I love it, it's the kind of epic sound showing the full range of his mastery.

I won't hide RJD2 is part of these artists who largely inspired me... I've always loved hi style, his hip-hop inspired sampling breaks the frontiers of soul and funk. A funny story, RJD2 album has been released the same day as mine. As I was promoting it, I see a commentary of a fan "between your album and rjd2's we're well served today"... I was divided between "shit, how come I could make this mistake?" and "amazing, let's listen to his new album". Finally I decided to take an hour to fully enjoy it.**"**

## Chinese Man - The Reminder
Degiheugi: **"**Chinese Man because, in the style I'm doing, there're at an upper level... and when they produce a track like that, they demonstrate the best of their art.

Their live show is astonishing, it's like an explosion of positive vibes whetever they'd do. I don't know them but I guess they're super cool, that's what their music suggests to me.

On top of that, they're independant. They got their own label and manage everything by themselves. It's something I deeply respect since I'm doing the same, at and other (and smaller) scale...**“**
