<br><br>

</p>

# Bonnie Banane's selection

## Mononeon – I'm a raggedy bitch but my heart is amazing
Bonnie Banane: **"**When I listen to Mononeon and his hilariously titled songs, I feel like I'm connecting with God while at the same time taking my leave of him. It's the music of times off.**"**

## Brigitte Bardot – C'est rigolo
Bonnie Banane: **"**When I wake up in a good mood, I want to play this song to feel like I'm in the middle of the playground.It gets me off on the right foot, makes me want to go on adventures, to flip pancakes, to set off firecrackers on street corners.**"**

## Take 6 – He never sleeps
Chico: **"**Take 6, I tried before going to sleep but I much preferred it for the morning.
It's totally made for the morning.This one is when you haven't slept all night.And that we find ourselves on Sunday morning still tired from the day before.With a carnal need to be wrapped softly. **"**
