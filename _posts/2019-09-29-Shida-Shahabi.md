<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome the intimate and homespun piano of Stockholm-based pianist and composer, [Shida Shahabi](https://shida-shahabi.bandcamp.com/).
<br><br>
Mainly featuring an old Swedish upright piano as its sole instrument, Shida Shahabi's debut album—Homes—released almost a year ago delves deep into explorations of intimate piano tones. Living comfortably with traces of wear and decay, its production eschews the prioritising of fussy cleanliness, with a warm, fuzzy noise floor audible from the very first track immediately immersing the listener into this quieter brand of assurance and imperfection—as though the whole existed beneath a layer of dust.
<br><br>
Her second LP, [Shifts](https://shida-shahabi.bandcamp.com/album/shifts), will be released on 8th November.
</p>

# Shida Shahabi's selection

## Mayumi Miyata – 双調調子
_Shida Shahabi_: **"**[Mayumi Miyata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayumi_Miyata)’s way of playing the Shō is magical and has been something I’ve listened to at home for quite a while now, such a lovely sound world to be in.**"**

## Lamine Konté – Dioula
_Shida Shahabi_: **"**I have also been spinning [Lamine Konté](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1060813-Lamine-Kont%C3%A9)’s 'La Kora Du Sénégal' a lot recently at home. I love the sound texture, harmonies and the percussive qualities of the Cora.**"**

## Lotic – Solace
_Shida Shahabi_: **"**[Lotic](https://soundcloud.com/lotic)’s Power is one of my favourite releases from last year, love the production and mix, super excited too see what comes next from them.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Shida Shahabi – Pretty In Plums
_Sanjay_: **"**I first heard Shida Shahabi's music when previous MailTape guest, [Adrian of Glockenspiel](https://www.mailta.pe/342/glockenspiel/), chose one of her tracks in his selection. This track was one of the first I heard after that episode, and for me, it perfectly symbolises the sparse and intimate sonic explorations of her music. It has an intricate pattern looped and gently built upon with no sense of rush or obligation.**"**

## Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch – Strelka
_Sanjay_: **"**Taken from [Linda May Han Oh](https://lindamayhanoh.com/)'s third studio album, Walking Against Wind, 'Firedancer' makes nice use of silence and contrast. Pianist Fabian Almazani and Ben Wendel on tenor saxophone feature prominently on this track—Fabian's left hand in unison with Linda's acoustic bass melody and his right hand punching accents along with Ben Wendel.**"**

## Jatinder Singh Durhailay & David Edren – Tulsi
_Sanjay_: **"**[Ariwo](http://www.ariwomusic.com/) formed in London in 2015 and their debut LP released a couple of years later offered a snapshot of their sound: atmospheric electronica, hypnotising Cuban rhythms and almost transcendental grooves. Pouya Ehsaei, Hammadi Valdes, Orneste Noda and Jay Phelps take their collective name from the Yoruba word for noise. The Yoruba traditions were forcibly transplanted in Cuba during the Middle Passage with some traces remaining in present-day spiritualism and music.**"**

## Vanessa Wagner – Struggle For Pleasure (GAS Rework)
_Sanjay_: **"**[Lifted](https://p-a-n.org/release/lifted-2-pan-85/) is a collaborative musical ensemble featuring Future Times boss Max D, Matt Papich aka Co La, Jeremy Hyman and Motion Graphics, as well as contributions from Beatrice Dillon, Bass Clef, Will DiMaggio, Jordan GCZ and more. Late nights and early mornings are blurred in this smoked-out and amorphous joint. 'Rose 31' is brightly lit by mellow flute, woodwind and sax, with an uncomplicated drum pattern shuffling along underneath.**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday for the start of a new season. Much love and respect to [Maria Chiara Argirò](https://www.mariachiaramusic.com/) for kicking it off again with her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for her brilliant illustration!</p>
