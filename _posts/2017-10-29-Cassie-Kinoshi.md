# Cassie Kinoshi's selection



## Kiran Kai ft. Jordan Rakei & Bdrsk – FF
_Cassie Kinoshi_: **"**As a freelancer, I often forget to take care of my mental well-being by dedicating time to myself. I’ve been trying to prioritise self-care in my schedule and slowly started to introduce what I call “Self-care Sundays” where I relax and take it easy for the whole day. This is the perfect tune to accompany easing into a reflective Sunday morning with a cup of tea.**"**

## Andrew Poppy – Last Light
_Cassie Kinoshi_: **"**[Andrew Poppy](http://www.andrewpoppy.co.uk/Welcome.html) has always been a composer I’ve admired since having him as a teacher at university. I feel that he’s is one of the reasons I survived at conservatoire! This piece has been on repeat for a while—I really enjoy listening to compositions that are full of texture, colour and so abstractly beautiful that you lose yourself within and becoming enveloped in the sound.**"**

## Oscar Jerome – You Take Me
_Cassie Kinoshi_: **"**One of my favourite guitarists on the London scene to work with; I was super excited when I heard that [Oscar Jerome](https://twitter.com/oscjerome) would finally be releasing his music last year. The writing, production and arrangements on this EP are so thorough—you can tell Oscar put his heart and soul into making this and his music never fails to transport me every time I listen.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Cassie Kinoshi ft. Heidi Heidelberg — The Dream Keeper
_Sanjay_: **"**It's not often we get to present the work of poets on MailTape, but I'm glad we are! Conveying mixed emotions of hope and fear, this composition from Cassie Kinoshi makes me want to curl up in an armchair and read more [Langston Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes)...'away from the too-rough fingers of the world'.**"**

## Mazz Swift – Invisible (Dedicated to Trayvon Martin and his Family)
_Sanjay_: **"**Dedicated to Trayvon Martin and his family, this is Mazz Swift's contribution to the first CD release from Con Vivo Music, '[Modern Dances](https://soundcloud.com/convivomusic/sets/modern-dances)', featuring music by their members. I saw Mazz perform last Sunday with [Hear in Now](http://www.hearinnow.com/) at The Vortex in London alongside Tomeka Reid, Silvia Bolognesi and Alexander Hawkins. So good!**"**

## Collocutor — Arrival
_Sanjay_: **"**This track is taken from the second album by [Collocutor](https://collocutor.uk/), a London-based ensemble led by saxophonist [Tamar Osborn](https://tamarosborn.com/). This is beautiful modal music ranging from afrobeat to polyphonic choral music. The entire EP resonates with some really nice brass arrangements combined with ethereal solos. Perfect for the onset of autumn.**"**

## Moses Boyd Exodus — Nocturne
_Sanjay_: **"**I feel there's a lot more music to come from [Moses Boyd](http://www.mosesboyd.co.uk/) & Co. and it's been a pretty exciting experience hearing them live every time I've had the opportunity. While evocative of the night, I think this works just as well for a (very early?) Sunday morning!**"**
