<p id="introduction"> This morning something strange is floating in the air. The sky takes on psychedelic colors, the sun hits the windows like percussions. Can you see [The Mauskovic Dance Band](https://mauskovicdanceband.bandcamp.com/) slowly emerging from the clouds to join us for a new MailTape episode?
<br><br>
It's been a long time 
</p>


# The Mauskovic Dance Band's selection

## Dj Bert & Eagle - I Am Your Master
The Mauskovic Dance Band: **"**A very disturbing but relaxing song i like to listen too while being massaged in the morning.**"**

## Don Melody Club - Bovendien
The Mauskovic Dance Band: **"**Our band mate Donald recently released his first solo record under the name [Don Melody Club](https://donmelodyclub.bandcamp.com/). Make a cup of coffee and let Donald's voice and Maestro Rhythm box sooth you on this Sunday morning with the track “Bovendien"**"**

## Cameleon - La Rosée Si Feuilles Songes
The Mauskovic Dance Band: **"**Opener of the brilliant compilation 'Ote Maloya' with music from the island of Réunion. Our drummer Chris just recently discovered this compilation and has been obsessively listening to these hypnotising grooves ever since.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [The Mauskovic Dance Band](https://mauskovicdanceband.bandcamp.com/) - Ventura Phase
Jules: **"**If the name of this group sounds strange to you, the resume of its leader shouldn't be unfamiliar. After having been a drummer for Jacco Gardner and Altin Gün, notably, multi-instrumentalist Nicola Mauskovic surrounded himself with friends and family members to form this group with its indescribable sound, a mixture of afrobeat under acid and cosmic cumbia. What you need to wake up full of energy!**"**

## Ensemble Entendu - Time Is Certainly Passing
Jules: **"**Ensemble Entendu is a collaborative project of Brooklyn-based producers Photay and Sam O.B, an aside in their solo career which allows them to explore new rhythms, halfway between their respective universes. I only recently discovered the 3 EPs they released on the Astro Nautico label and have since developed a nostalgic obsession for this track that has accompanied my summer.**"**

## [Turzi](https://www.facebook.com/TurziOfficial) - Watermill
Jules: **"**I discovered this song on a compilation released by Munich-based label [Public Possession](https://publicpossession.bandcamp.com/), also a label whose music has accompanied me a lot this summer, from party nights to the seaside.**"**

## N'Draman-Blintch - Cosmic Sounds
Jules: **"**A musical discovery that I'm still struggling to recover from! This gem of a song, originally from Nigeria, is currently being repressed by Marseille-based label [Secousse](https://secousse.bandcamp.com/album/cosmic-sounds-repress), 38 years after its original release. It's hard to believe that we have missed this afro disco masterpiece for so long.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [The Mauskovic Dance Band](https://mauskovicdanceband.bandcamp.com/) for their crazy Sunday selections, and many thanks to [Jason Pridham](https://www.instagram.com/grancharismo/) for this episode's stunning illustration!</p>
