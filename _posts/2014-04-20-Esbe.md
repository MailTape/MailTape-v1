<p id="introduction">
This morning, our guest [Esbe](http://switchy.bandcamp.com/ "Esbe Bandcamp") from L.A. will give you time to wake up. You may feel hypnotized during the first two tracks but don't worry ! Have a stretch, take a big breath, and let your imagination feel the fresh air coming from the West Coast out of this selection.</p>

# Head in the stars
Sometimes we need a walk, a time for reflection. The lucky ones live nearby a nice shore, breathing sea air, their face skimmed by a little breeze. Feet in the sand, mind in the sky... That's how you might feel if you take [Esbe](https://soundcloud.com/esbe1988 "Esbe Soundcloud") music for a walk. His melodic softness should lead you to pause and wonder how to truly enjoy your sunday.

# His morning thoughts ...

## Jenova 7 & Mr. Moods - Faded
**"**This is a track by two of my favorite producers and peers from their collaborate album **"**Time Traveller**"**. A feel good nostalgic vibe track that I can't get enough of. Subtle flute/strings and hunting vocals gives me that warm feelings in my chest.**"**

## DSK - Winter Lane (Nujabes Remix)
**"**One of my all time favorite track, I'm a sucker for vibey acoustic guitar riffs. No other song lifts my spirit like this track. The way the intro start with a strong drums,the guitar riff that takes me to a memory lane and the climax of the track with horns and flutes are pure energy.**"**

## Shingo Suzuki - Inside your love
**"**A head nodding track by a japanese producer, nice jazzy song with groovy drums and bassline with a lick of guitars that puts me in a good mood.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to [Esbe](https://www.facebook.com/Esbe1988 "Esbe Facebook") for his selection. Thanks for listening, enjoy your sunday!
