This morning, join us in our quest for the new future sound. [Daktyl](https://www.facebook.com/daktylmusic "His facebook"), known to make insane beats mixing hip-hop, soul, garage and bass, will be our guide. Embark on our flying synth and let’s flow together.</p>

# New sound inventor

With his multi-instrumentalist talents and classic background, Daktyl tries to push the boundaries of music a bit further every time he releases something new. Building a vast music universe, one can feel his deep desire to reach uniqueness without loosing consistency along the journey. Can’t wait to listen his next releases.

# His morning inspiration

## Point Point - Life In Grey
Daktyl: **"**Amazing tune! The way they've manipulated the vocal is incredible and that lead gets me every time. It's so bouncy and vibrant. Perfect tune to start off a Sunday. **"**

## Tom Misch - Lush Life
Daktyl: **"**I love this song. Been listening to it a lot recently, it's so simple but so smooth. The guitar riff is incredible. Just makes me wanna be by a pool sipping some fresh mango juice.**"**

## Tourist - Placid Acid
Daktyl: **"**Probably one of the best songs to get out of bed to ever. The way it builds! The harmonies at like 2:38 as well....**"**
