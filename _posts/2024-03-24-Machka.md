<p id="introduction">Greeting, greetings!<br /><br />With spring finally breezing in the air, our fourth MailTape LIVE event is also only less than 5 days away. There is no better time to have Machka, who will showcase her DJ set at our event, to sit in and share with us some of her favourite Sunday tunes.<br /><br />Machka is Eleonore Reyes, the Franco-Colombian artist’s electro-instrumental project, that travels through melancholic ambient, rapid-fired broken beats and mystical trance. The composer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist is often fascinated by the environmental sounds of our world, she loves to play around with electronic components, acoustic compositions and field recordings to transport the listeners towards unexpected turns and territories. Her stellar debut EP “[L’Aigle et Le Serpent](https://machka.bandcamp.com/album/laigle-et-le-serpent)” was released last June.</p>

# Machka's selection

## [Orbital](https://www.orbitalofficial.com/) - Halcyon and on and on

Machka:**"**Invoking a feeling on peace and happiness - as the mystical bird <Halcyon> refers to (they had the power too calm down the agitated waves over the sea) - this track reminds me the softness of seeing the sun rise after a (sober for myself) party, or the feeling of falling in love with the rising beauty of life.**"**


## [User18081971](https://soundcloud.com/user18081971/qu-1) - Qu1

S8JFOU: **"**One of the most beautiful ambient tracks I've listened to so far,
given by an illustrious musician of our time (Aphex Twin, editor's note) under
another pseudonym, in memory of his father who died that year.**"**

## [Rob Clouth](https://robclouth.bandcamp.com/track/a-shiver-sequence) - A Shiver Sequence

S8JFOU: **"**Huge research of distorted and reverberated electro-acoustic
textures in a beautiful melancholic atmosphere. A very nice way to make
electronic music with audio recordings. This track and the album on which it is
present takes me very far into other worlds.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [S8JFOU](https://s8jfou.bandcamp.com/track/influences) - Influences

Guillaume: **"**S8JFOU's latest album, Op.Echo, does not take its name from
nothing. Composed with only two Ableton plugins, Operator and Echo, it
paradoxically embarks us for an extraordinary rich and textured adventure.
Peaceful and floating tracks alternate with more dark and broken stories. How is
S8JFOU able to do that with just two Ableton plugins? Real magic, we may say.

The wonderful piece "Influences", track 2 of the album, shows how tortured
S8JFOU's music can feel. Just the right balance between the soaring atmosphere
of the Ambient pads and the texture of the strong IDM/breakbeat vibe on
top.**"**

## [Squarepusher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4UGYSs56MM) - Tundra 4

Guillaume: **"**Speaking of IDM, here is a track from Squarepusher, one of the
fathers of the genre. With "Tundra 4", we're not too far from what a perfect
opera piece should look like when composed with electronic music in mind.
The 13 minutes of this striking mix of IDM, Breakbeat and Ambient will certainly
move you to somewhere else.**"**

## [Emperors New Clothes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJrjHJSJci0) - Darklight

Guillaume: **"**Let's take a step back to breath a little after those crushing
emotions. With Emperors New Clothes, a mega-band of 10 people, we're up to a
rare mix of Jazz, Folk music and Ambient with "Darkligh" from their Wisdom And
Lies album from 1995. The track leaves us with is this peaceful feeling
sprinkled with just enough of mysterious vibes.**"**

## [Saycet](https://saycet-music.bandcamp.com/track/mother-s8jfou-remix) - Mother (S8JFOU Remix)

Guillaume: **"**Last but not least, a remix of "Mother" from Saycet by our guest
today. If you read the few articles you can find about S8JFOU over the
internets, you will discover that Saycet is part of the reasons Billy chose the
music path in his life. It was Saycet's album One Day At Home After that made
him discovered this very niche kind of music: this mix of melancholia and
texture that we now find in everywhere in S8JFOU's productions**"** 

<p id="outroduction">That’s it for this Sunday morning! We hoped you travelled
far with today's selection, up to some distant planets or spaceships around.
Many thanks to [S8FJOU](https://www.s8jfou.com/) for his selection and [Meriam
Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for today's beautiful
