<p id="introduction">Let's welcome this Sunday with a multitude of influences and sounds that will start the day in the most beautiful way. Coming straight from the most cosmopolitan city of France, the selection of [BIENSÜRE](https://www.facebook.com/biensurebiensure) comes to brighten our ears, at the crossroads of several influences, from Syria to Marseille. 
  With so much musicality, your Sunday starts off on the right foot.</p>


# BIENSÜRE's selection

## [Chaama](https://www.instagram.com/chaama_z/) - ALABASS (produced by [Haris Hamza](https://soundcloud.com/hamza-haris)) 
BIENSÜRE: **«**Chaama and Haris Hamza take up and integrate the current sounds of an old Algerian song. The mix of influences of past and present is important for us, the melancholic mood with Arabian tones is subtly realized.**»**

## [BADBADNOTGOOD](https://badbadnotgood.bandcamp.com) - Time Moves Slow (feat. Sam Herring)
BIENSÜRE: **«**This track produced by those extremly talented instrumentalists has always inspired us with its groove and its subtlety. The sound of each musician is accurate and very precise, this current jazz style is one of our references.**»**

## [Mr. De'](https://soundcloud.com/mr-de) - Sex On The Beach 2000 (feat. Greg C. Brown)
BIENSÜRE: **«**The Chicago house or guettotech from the 90s is a real reference for us. The bass sounds, the broken drums - precursor of the trap - and the general vibe that this track gives off is undeniably part of BIENSÜRE's DNA.**»**

## [Akbaba İkilisi](https://soundcloud.com/akbabaikilisi) - Darıldım Darıldım (feat. Arif Sağ)
BIENSÜRE: **«**Impossible to avoid this title from the archives of Turkish label Uzelli. This music is traditional but modern in the arrangements. Undeniable reference of the future Turkish disco of the 70s with Baris Manco and Erkin Koray to name a few. The sound of the electric Saz is recorded to perfection, it's a reference of sonority for us.**»**

# MailTape's selection

## [BIENSÜRE](https://www.facebook.com/biensurebiensure) - Demme
Arthur: **«**iuhij
**»**

## [Luke Vibert](https://soundcloud.com/luke-vibert) - Batter Bits
Arthur: **«**Influence by the great bass developed in Glenn Astro's track, the name of Luke Vibert came to mind spontaneously. Another great artist always full of surprises and pushing his limits in every new release. What a pleasure to find this new track recently.**»**

## [Kelly Lee Owens](https://kellyleeowens.bandcamp.com) - My Own
Arthur: **«**Smooth and delicate track by Kelly for the tiring collective moment we're going through. A good reminder about the importance of caring for each other and oneself with deep sincerity. Thank you, Kelly.**»**

## [Khalab & M'berra Ensemble](https://djkhalab.bandcamp.com/album/mberra) - Skit Guit
Arthur: **«**World is vast, beautiful, and diverse. Who needs to go to Mars when such poetry surrounds us?**»**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Take great care, share the love. Much love to [Glenn Astro](https://glennastro.bandcamp.com)for his inspring Sunday selections and to Meriam Kherbat for her dear illustration!</p>
