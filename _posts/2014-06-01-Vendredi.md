This morning, we’ll start the day with a very aerial and bliss selection inspired by the french duo [Vendredi](https://www.facebook.com/vendredimusic "Check them on fb"). Each beat feeds our imagination, enlarging our vision. New landscapes, before hidden, now appears. Head in the sky, feet on the ground, let’s explore the world with an open heart like Jacques Tati used to.</p>

# Musicians and storytellers

With their debut EP, [Veneries Dies](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/veneris-dies-ep/id823647184 "Listen to it on iTunes"), [Vendredi](https://www.facebook.com/vendredimusic "Check them on fb") creates intriguing wild landscapes where majestuous trees have taken back their land over the ancient ruins of a previous civilisation. Oscillating between dreamy, bliss and trippy vibes, rare are the french artists who try to compete with the like of Flying Lotus and Amon Tobin. For this, we can only respect them and wish them the best.

# Their morning inspiration

## Tosca - Stuttgart feat. Lucas Santtana (Marlow & Trüby refix)
Vendredi: **"**We discovered this tune last year in may on a Gilles Peterson Worldwide Show, it was particularly appropriate for the weather ! Just frivolity and those Brazilian lyrics just drive us crazy, so delightful. Perfect for a springtime walk in Paris.**"**

## Darondo - Didn't I
Vendredi: **"**Tenderness and sadness at the same time, this track means a lot for both of us. The happiness of the melody cut’s off with the depth and bitterness of the lyrics, that’s what we specially love this song.**"**

## James Blake - CMYK
Vendredi: **"**This track gives to us the same euphoria each time we listen to it, years by years, since the first day. There’s a kind of jubilation so contagious!**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to [Vendredi](https://www.facebook.com/vendredimusic "Check them on fb") for their selection. Thanks for listening and enjoy your sunday !
