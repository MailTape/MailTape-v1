<p id="introduction">
This morning, here's a Mailtape inspired by [Fragments](https://www.facebook.com/frgmntsmusic "Fragments' Facebook Page"). You're bound to wake up in a good mood by the end of this sunday selection. Enjoy the lively rhythms of these tracks and you will be powered for the rest of the day. </p>
 
# Ethearal vibes

Fragments' music is all about freedom. It's impossible to put them inside a tiny little box that defines a musical genre. Without any words, they express their own poetry. Close your eyes and imagine a land echoing with the rhythms of their music. 

Their morning selection is a perfect mirror to how eclectic their inspirations are. It contains everything you need to kindle your imagination, from the soaring chorus to the kind piano melody, just let your mind wander.

# Fragments' morning inspiration
 
## Maps - A.M.A
_Benjamin:_ **"**It’s an ultra pop song that lingers in the mind after the party the night before. And it keeps the party going until you wake up with a smile in the morning.**"**
 
## Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti - Round and Round
_Tom:_ **"**This song is a cure to melancholia. The bridge at two minutes feels just like a sunny Sunday. If everyone listened to Ariel Pink, less people would fight with each other.**"**
 
## Julien Marchal - I
_Sylvain:_ **"**Because it's soft; because the sound of the piano is just a wonder and even more because he's a Frenchman.**"**
