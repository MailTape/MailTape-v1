# Phaon's selections
##  Pond - Daisy
Phaon: **"**An introduction like a sunrise, like a morning with psychedelic residues. A pop production with a bass/drum worthy of the disco's dance floor, 80's synths shining on a surf guitar. Nothing better to cast offand venture into unknown waters.**"**

## Alain Bashung - Mes Bras
Phaon: **"**Bashung is one of the references we are most often quoted after a concert. This allowed us to discover his works, to which we became attached. "Mes bras" is a ballad of 7 minutes 50 seconds with an impressive charisma. The lyrics, the choice of rhythms, the musical production. There is this attention to the sound of the words, to their placement in the verse, which is dear to us. This is the piece that refocuses our primary desires.**"**

Balthazar - Lion’s Mouth (Daniel
We have Belgium at our heart in the band. Without it, Phaon would not be. Its base comes from this country, from this cultural sponge, from its bands: BRNS,Dan San,Arno, Italian Boyfriend... and Balthazar.This track is about rainy Sundays when the vinyl spins on the turntable, plaid on itself and the window for only horizon. An auditory wonder.

Phaon - Phobie Nocturne

Miel de Montagne - Trop Vite

PI - Moitié 

Chatain - Noyade
