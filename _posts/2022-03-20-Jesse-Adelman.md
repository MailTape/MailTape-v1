<p id="introduction">This morning, we're ringing in the day with smooth sunshine tracks introduced by our dear guest, [Raw Poetic](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/). The project of Jason Moore, Raw Poetic's music dips into treadings of hip hop, jazz, folk, and soul. Instead of categorizing his work, Jason simply says, "what it sounds like is what it sounds like." His production style follows this free form and flowing process, where finished products are not hindered by any certain categorical distinction.  
  <br><br>
Raw Poetic's latest album, [Laminated Skies](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/album/laminated-skies), releases in just 5 days, on March 18. The album features many of Raw Poetic's familiar collaborators, including Earl Davis, Luke Stewart, Patrick Fritz, and Damu the Fudgemunk. At its core, Raw Poetic describes this release as a "Jason Album," one that draws particular breath from Jason's experience. 
   <br><br>
  Featuring many references to Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, the album includes Jason's meditations of his experience as a Black man in America, and Northern Virginia specifically. Just as Ellison describes, this means feeling at once anonymous, hypervisible, and at times invincible; a space where it's easy to also feel lost. Laminated Skies represents Jason's work through of his experience, a patchwork of genre and style, coming together into something that can also be described as Jason.

# Jesse Adelman's selection

## David Nance - Save Me Some Tears
Jesse Adelman: **"**Staunch Honey is one of my favorite albums of the past couple years. It’s lo-fi and ragged, everything feels spur-of-the-moment and shaggy but the tunes are super balanced and propulsive. I’m pretty sure this whole record is David multitracking himself but he does it direct to tape (brave hero) whereas I track on a laptop rig (nerd coward).**"**

## Jim O'Rourke - All Downhill From Here
Jesse Adelman: **"**20 years ago Jim O’Rourke was producing Sonic Youth and Smog and Wilco and somewhere in there he made two solo pop albums called “Eureka” and “Insignificance.” They are kind of impossible to find but they’re both amazing. The mixes are aggressively clean and dry but the writing and arrangements are crazy, he conjures so much energy out of the performances and he’s floating these sardonic lyrics right on top, deadpan.**"**

## Sam Prekop - Chicago People
Jesse Adelman: **"**Sam is the frontman of The Sea and Cake and these days he’s doing ambient modular synth records (which rule) but his solo album from 2005 and this song in particular have stuck with me over the years as a masterpiece of restrained tension, he captures so much emotion with a few whispers, pretty spare instrumentation, just great writing and playing. The horn voicings on this intro, those muted cornets, the harmony is bittersweet and then it’s melancholy and then it resolves and just floods your brain with dopamine. I do a ton of background vocal layering on my own stuff — I’m chasing the feeling that this record nails with a three horn stack.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Jesse Adelman - xx
Sarah : **"**Such gentle melodies interlaced so carefully over each other, floating along through the track like flowers in water. Raw Poetic describes this track as the healing process from a particularly turbulent relationship, one that he knew wasn't going to last. The lyrics describe their story so beautifully, with the pendulum swings and so many other moments tinged with a special nostalgia, a proper goodbye. Love the watery quality created by this side swaying bass, xylophone, and smooth vocals, contrasting so nicely with Patrick Fritz's higher guitar riff comp. A testament to the "Jason-ness" of this album, the track dips into hip hop, folk, and soul movements, but not lingering too long on any one genre.**"**  

## [Damu the Fudgemunk](https://damuthefudgemunk.bandcamp.com/), [Raw Poetic](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/music) - Power of the Mind
Sarah: **"**Raw Poetic is dominating this playlist, but there was simply too much to choose from. One of the many collaborations between Damu the Fudgemunk and Raw Poetic, this track is lifted from Damu's alum [Conversation Peace](https://damuthefudgemunk.bandcamp.com/album/conversation-peace). Struck by the xylophone with the easy energy of the rap verses. Love the sax and piano openings towards the end, smooth :)**"**

## [DARGZ](https://dargz.bandcamp.com/), [Moses Boyd](http://www.mosesboyd.co.uk/) - Happiness
Sarah: **"**The piano and synth spirals weaving around the bass section are absolutely intoxicating. One of the latest singles from producer DARGZ, off of the [Happiness EP](https://dargz.bandcamp.com/track/happiness-feat-charlie-stacey-moses-boyd). Really nice placement in the release, adding some instrumental breath before Hold On, Pt. 2, starting the EP nicely.**"**

## [India Blue](https://indiablue.bandcamp.com/) - Magpie
Sarah: **"**Finishing off this eclectic selection with a track from India Blue's 2022 album, [The Circus Came and Left](https://indiablue.bandcamp.com/album/the-circus-came-and-left). Love the vocal layering on this one. Calming and yet celestial, a testament to India Blue's self descriptions as faerie-folk. Wonderful for pulling yourself out of a sleepy morning.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That finishes our playlist  for this morning! Our thanks to [Raw Poetic](https://rawpoetic.bandcamp.com/music) for his wonderful Sunday selection. Many thanks to Noémie Dijon for this episode's stellar illustration!</p>
