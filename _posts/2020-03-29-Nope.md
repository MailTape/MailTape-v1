Sacrifices - Dreamville : After saturday's night fever comes the sunday's hangover moments, Sacrices from Dreamville helps me to start a new day with a smooth vibe for the waking up and a bit of energy to get me out of bed. 

Dumebi - Rema : Rema's voice and all the sounds give me crazy energy, this song helps me get up on the right foot every day I hear it. All the elements are gathered to bring us into the world of the artist who is only 19 years old. If you need motivation to go to work or to a party where you don't want to go, you need to listen to this asap !

Hand me downs - Mac Miller : This song is just ... waaaaouh. Mac Miller's death was and still is a real loss for the music world. This guy had a crazy talent especially to put words on these feelings and put them to music in the beautiful way as possible. There're so many emotions in this song that it's impossible to feel nothing. This track sounds like a masterpiece in my ears.
