<p id="introduction">
This morning, we're going to remind you that sometimes it's important to swap your coffee with a beer ! 
Go out, buy a ticket for a concert and if you're lucky enough, you'll make some cool discoveries as for us with [Catching Flies](https://soundcloud.com/catchingfliesmusic "Catching Flies Soundcloud Page").</p>

# From a live session... 
We asked few people around us, no one seemed to know him but everyone was looking at each other asking **"**Who's that guy, that's sweet !**"**.  Peacefully, he did an impressive live. If you come across him, we highly recommend ! 

# ... To a morning selection
We thought he would be a perfect guest for a morning selection, hope you'll enjoy.

## Fatima feat. Floating Points - Mind
**"**Wicked track, a perfect start to Sunday mornings. The tune is produced by Floating Points... Floating points & Fatima = Killer combo! Check out the EP he produced for her called **‘**Follow You.**’****"**

## Gap Mangione - Diana In The Autumn Wind
**"**I love this tune. Nice and mellow for Sundays - those rhodes! This tune was sampled by J Dilla on **‘**Fall in Love**’** by Slum Village - so I’d probably listen to that next!**"**

## Grandbrothers - Ezra Was Right
**"**I love this tune, probably my favourite at the moment. Nice and mellow for Sundays… and the way it builds!! Just wait…**"**

<p id="outroduction">
That’s all folks! A big thank to [Catching Flies](http://catchingflies.bandcamp.com/album/the-long-journey-home "Catching Flies Bandcamp Page") for his selection. Thanks for listening and enjoy your sunday!
