<p id="introduction">This morning, juggle the calm and energetic moments thrown your way by [Requin Chagrin](https://www.facebook.com/chagrin.requin/ "Facebook")’s eclectic selection. Requin Chagrin, a French band born from singer Marion’s mind, mixes surf-ish reverb guitars with a melancholic vibe, creating a warm and languid sound.</p>
<p>During this precisely 30-minute selection, travel through France, Norway, the US and the UK, feel both warmth and coldness, take a few breaths and dance (alone) in your room. Sunnier days don’t seem that far away now.</p>


# **Requin Chagrin’s selection**

+ ## Barbagallo - Nouveau Sidobre
_Marion from Requin Chagrin_: **"**I had the chance to see them play at Point Éphémère in Paris last December and it was great. Since then I've had this song in my head, as was the case last Sunday, so it's perfect!**"**

+ ## Kommode - Patient
_Romain from Requin Chagrin_: **"**I hardly ever listen to music on Soundcloud, but I stumbled back across this (put into my favourites five years ago...). "Kommode" is the solo project of Eirik Glambek Bøe, a member of Kings Of Convenience (which I am a long-time fan of) but who unfortunately never released more than two songs.
When Kings Of Convenience decided to separate in order to concentrate on their solo projects, member Erlend formed The Whitest Boy Alive and I found it superb. I was expecting the same on the part of Eirik, but that has sadly not been the case.
Generally speaking, I like the refreshing difference of these small Norwegian geniuses, one of the reasons for which I would like to take a holiday there one day, lost among the mountains and lakes.**"**

+ ## MJ Guider - Lit Negative
_Yohann from Requin Chagrin_: **"**I recently discovered the label Kranky, whose experimental and airy editorial line I have found quite similar to Sacred Bones Records.
Released by them in 2016, this great album from MJ Guider possesses an interesting dichotomy, from mixing floaty oneirism, ghostly song and industrial coolness. A winning combination to drown you in your Sunday torpor.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Requin Chagrin - Le Chagrin
_Inès_: **"**Taken from their first release on [La Souterraine](http://souterraine.biz/ "Site"), “Le Chagrin” has this summery vibe that can be found across Requin Chagrin’s other tracks. This song is ingeniously confusing: the melancholy felt on Marion’s voice (« le chagrin » means « the sorrow » after all) is met with joyful synths and a punchy guitar/bass duo. Should we be crying? Should we be dancing? Both?**"** 

+ ## Vril - Torus XXXII
_Inès_: **"**Time for some rest before attacking the rest of this selection. Put on your headphones, close your eyes, meditate or whatever. Follow this song’s progress, bringing elements from all sides to its core, developing over its 6-minutes course to become powerful in its minimalism.**"**

+ ## Gorgeous Bully - Kidding (ft. Whorish Boorish)
_Inès_: **"**Gorgeous Bully is one of my favorite musical discoveries in the last few years, always managing to get the perfect mix between dreamy, lo-fi sounds and a hint of melancholy. “Kidding” magnifies this whole sound with the lovely intertwining of the voices. Simply beautiful.**"**

+ ## Vundabar - Darla
_Inès_: **"**Mathrock guitars, jerky drums and an unexpected structure: a trio that never seems to get tired for me. Vundabar’s songs are always so full of good energy, and this one in particular feels like being in a small kind of roller coaster, switching between tiny adrenaline rushes and calmer moments. I guess now we’re all hyped up and ready to go on with our day!**"**
