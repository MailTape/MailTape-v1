<p id="introduction">This morning, Mailtape presents a brand new kind of issues! Did you notice this "Records" thing in the title? We've decided to start inviting record labels every now and then! As you know, we aspire to discover new inspiring music every Sunday; with labels guests, we will be able to introduce you to an entire catalog each time! Hope you'll enjoy. </p>

# Indie or die

To introduce this new formula, welcome Talitres! It's been 15 years of amazingly creative and introspective music since their creation. Sean Bouchard is the mastermind behind all this indie madness! Humbly, he only selected one artist of his own catalog, North American band _Le Loup_. You will also come across _Rachel Dadd_ and _Will Samson_ in our selection... And theses artists are just a glimpse of what you can hope to discover in Talitres' releases.

# Talitres's selection:

## Mark Kozelek & Jimmy Lavalle - By The Time That I Awoke
_Sean Bouchard_: **"**Early 90's I was fascinated by the slow core scene of the west coast: American Music Club, Idaho, Swell, Red House Painters, and many more... Mark Kozelek, founding members of Red House Painters remained very prolific, with a real artistic integrity. What a beauty, suspended, timeless, a real gem, it's remarkable. And a sweet thing to wake up to on a Sunday.**"**

## Sufjan Stevens - Should Have Known Better
_Sean Bouchard_: **"**Steven Sufjan is a real treasure from all points of view: outstanding releases, relevant collaborations, new challenges...and above all his music. "_Carrie & Lowell_" is a tender, touching and poignant album and above all disarmingly appealing.**"**

## Le Loup - Morning Song
_Sean Bouchard_: **"**Le Loup was an American indie band founded in Washington, D.C. by Sam Simkoff and with their bandmates they did a harmonious family. Fleet Foxes-style, Appalachian sounds, hymnal harmonies, and avant garde leanings. We love that freedom, that freshness, their sweet experimentation.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to Ã‰douard and to [Sean Bouchard, CEO of Talitres Records](https://www.facebook.com/talitres/) for his selection. We hope you enjoyed this new kind of episodes, let us know your thoughts!</p>
