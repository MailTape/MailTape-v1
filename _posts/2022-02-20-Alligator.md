# Alligator's selection

## Cruisin' Gang - My Man
Alligator: **"**Italian disco gem discovered thanks to the remix of Hysteric in 2016.**"**

## Sister Irene O'Connor - Mass 'Emmanuel'
Alligator: **"**The Fire of God's Love album (1976) was produced and recorded entirely by two Australian sisters, Sister Irene O'Connor writing, singing and performing all the instruments, and Sister Marimil Lobregat doing all the recording, engineering and sound production. This is just amazing experimental Christian pop.**"**

## Cate Lebon - Home to You
Alligator: **"**Very nice track on the Reward album released in 2019. This track is more instrumental, with a melody played on the Xylophone and the voice of Cate Lebon always incredible. What is interesting is the structure of the track with breaks and shifts in the rhythm that seem simple but in reality quite complex. And especially the xylophone solo with one note reminds a little bit the guitar solos of Neil Young played on one note.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Luiza Brina - Somos Só
: **"**Such a beautiful release featuring Ana Frango Elétrico and Marcelo Costa. Brina's vocals surround the mix with an entrancing velvet quality. Love the steadiness of the guitar strumming, it gives the vocals all the space that they demand. A favorite from Brina's most recent releases.**"**

## OKI - Kai Kai As To (Rippling Lake)
Sarah: **"**Such a healing track, just like a rippling lake :) this entire album is such a wonder to listen through, each track offering something new and surprising. Love the bird vocalizations halfway through.**"**

## Jesse Adelman - Big Spaceship
Sarah: **"**What a dreamy embrace this song makes for us. Such a marbled texture of sound, with Adelman's grounded vocals streamlining through all of it.**"**

## Luiza Brina - A Toada Vem É Pelo Vento
Sarah: **"**A vibrant track to finish off this soothing Sunday selection :) Wonderful bass underscoring, adding such a driving momentum to the rest of the track's movement. The vocals contributes a somewhat dreamy haze, but with such a rousing instrumental section surrounding it**"**
