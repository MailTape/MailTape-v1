  This morning, let a terrific electronic tsunami flow in your head with our
  guest Jumo !
---
<p id="introduction">This morning, we are accompanied by a subtle yet poignant “Jumo”. Erasing the separation between chest and legs, on a non-caffeinated morning, your cells will blush from his unique electronic magnetism.</p>

# Blood Type Decaf 

If you’ve ever stopped drinking coffee for more than five days, you’ll notice that a certain part of you vanishes away. It makes you sleepy and angry, drowning in a phantom like universe. But if you’re patient enough, it ultimately amplifies your senses, awakening the truth. Your pace is slower, and your flesh as sensitive as the naked skin of a freshly groomed animal.  

Only then can you be electrified by “Jumo”. His music will magnify your cells, where you’ll feel and see all that exist. You’ll want to dance, a trance like journey into the wilderness of movement. A selection of “Photay”, “Seekae”, “Unno’’, like the secret language of a chipping bird wishing himself away, but it’s only music, there to nest you in the subtlety of each sound . 

The rest is as shifting as a solar august day, it will make you want to gravitate, rotate, unleash your limbs and tremble away. 

# Jumo's Selection:

## Photay - No Sass
_Jumo_:**"**Photay is a producer I admire. He's is incredibly technical, what touches me the most are the jazz and bossa influences in his productions. We should listen to it all!**"**

## Seekae - Test & Recognise (Flume Re-work)
_Jumo_:**"**I am naturally very influenced by Flume, his sounds, his dissonances, but what I prefer is the evidence in some of his tracks. This remix is a good example, it's simple and it works so well !**"**

## Unno - Salt
_Jumo_:**"**I was really astonished by this project of Nowadays Records, I rarely heard that before. They released Salt for the new edition of As We Land, I got blown away once more ! I like the mix of the instruments, the voices and the electronic sounds... this track takes me away**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Jumo](https://www.facebook.com/jumoproject/?fref=ts) for his selection, we hope you enjoyed the journey!</p>
