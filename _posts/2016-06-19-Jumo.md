<p id="introduction">This morning, </p>

# Titre


## Photay - No Sass
_Jumo_:**"**Photay is a producer I admire. He's is incredibly technical, what touches me the most are the jazz and bossa influences in his productions. We should listen to it all!**"**

## Seekae - Test & Recognise (Flume Re-work)
_Jumo_:**"**I am naturally very influenced by Flume, his sounds, his dissonances, but what I prefer is the evidence in some of his tracks. This remix is a good example, it's simple and it works so well !**"**

## Unno - Salt
_Jumo_:**"**I was really astonished by this project of Nowadays Records, I rarely heard that before. They released Salt for the new edition of As We Land, I got blown away once more ! I like the mix of the instruments, the voices and the electronic sounds... this track takes me away**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Jumo](https://www.facebook.com/jumoproject/?fref=ts) for his selection, we hope you enjoyed the journey!</p>
