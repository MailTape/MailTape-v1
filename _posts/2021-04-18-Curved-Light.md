<p id="introduction">
  This morning, we embrace the abstract in the ambient. The tracks in the following playlist reach for some kind of emptiness within us, offering a sense of peace as an olive branch. let the tightly folded laundry of your thoughts unravel, let them wave in the wind of these synthesizers. 
  peace can be so elusive, sometimes we forget it is a goal. 
  this sunday morning, we encourage you to breathe in and breathe out, to listen 
  delighted to welcome [Thijsenterprise](https://thijsenterprise.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape for a Sunday selection that explores non-traditional structures in music, each inspiring to Thijsenterprise in his life and projects.<br><br> 
  [Thijsenterprise](https://thijsenterprise.bandcamp.com/) is Dutch saxophonist, beatmaker, and composer Reinier Thijs, currently based in Barcelona. Immersed in the world of jazz and the likes of [Benjamin Herman](https://www.facebook.com/BenjaminHermanOfficial/), [John Coltrane](https://www.johncoltrane.com/), [Xero Slingsby](https://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/blog/who-xero-slingsby), and [Pharoah Sanders](https://pharoahsanders.wordpress.com/), Reinier also is passionate about the discographies of [The Lounge Lizards](https://www.discogs.com/artist/79333-Lounge-Lizards), [Knxwledge](https://knxwledge.bandcamp.com/), [Nate Smith](http://www.natesmithmusic.com/), and [Robert Glasper](https://www.robertglasper.com/). <br><br>
  It's this range of influence that not only informs the content of Thijsenterprise's music, but also his musical freedom. Pulling inspiration from bossa nova, electronic music, punk, jazz, and hip hop, Reinier does not find himself constrained to any one genre, leaning into tracks of non-conventional form in each of his albums' arenas.

# Curved Light's selection

## [Alice Coltrane](https://tomze.bandcamp.com/) – Hare Krishna (Universal Consciousness, 1971)
Curved Light: **"**I love all the complementing textures of this piece. If you only knew that the ensemble for this free jazz record included two simultaneous drummers and a string quartet, you'd never expect to hear a piece so sublime and transcendent, jubilant and ecstatic - a perfect way to rise with the sun.**"**

## [Tatsuro Yamashita](http://www.peterevanstrumpet.com/) – Ride on Time (Ride on Time, 1980)
Curved Light: **"**Clearly, the popularity of this song, and city pop as a whole, resonates so deeply with our current times. It so earnestly captures a feeling of nostalgia, yet was created as an artificial response to yesterday's pop - and now, we're rediscovering it through algorithms and other newly disseminated forms. Still, there's a reason this song remains relevant - it's a banger and really just gets ya movin'.**"**

## [Robin Guthrie](https://www.facebook.com/Jameszoomitchel/), Harold Budd – Flake
Curved Light: **"**This one is probably a better pick for a dreary Sunday morning, or after a late Saturday night. Its slow-moving current and masterful restraint lends itself to moody introspection, as expected of these brilliant artists - I could just listen to this one over and over.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Curved Light](https://thijsenterprise.bandcamp.com/) – El Arriero
Sarah: **"**Expansive and yet minimal, this track brings Curved Light the most peace from all of his discography. 
Ethereal. experimental, minimal, analog, psychedeloc. synth art. evolving arrangements.**"**

## [36 & awakened souls](https://pitp.bandcamp.com/album/the-other-side-of-darkness) – Past Self
Sarah: **"**Coming off the 2021 album, [The Other Side of Darkness](https://pitp.bandcamp.com/album/the-other-side-of-darkness). 
vocal textures 
ambient soundscape to embrace
such peace in this album.**"**

## [Triorität](https://trioritaet.bandcamp.com/album/alg0) – Bonopo
Sarah: **"**So many layers in this one, it feels like a floating dream of synths and jazz piano :) Organ currents lead and layer over each other, before clashing just as easily in a delightful heap of sound. This whole interaction is textured and grounded against the balance of organic percussion. The whirling wonderland of synths and chimes makes me forget any notion of time, as I imagine it may for you, too. The jazz percussion breaks by the midpoint are just as surprising as the piano takeover that brings us to the track's end.**"**

## [Gábor Szabó](https://www.discogs.com/artist/22851-Gabor-Szabo)– Fire Dance
Sarah: **"**This one comes off of my favorite Gábor Szabó album, [Dreams](https://lightintheattic.net/releases/6556-dreams) (1968). Such a phenomenal jazz-crossover; the album is a kaleidoscope of sound: Southeast Asian folk riffs melt together with Szabó's traditional Hungarian influences, all tied into soft-swaying samba movements that rock against African drums and the ever-evolving jazz structures that underlay them. Szabó's guitar effortlessly glides along the song's development, this whole track moves like silk.**"**
