<p id="introduction">
  This morning, we embrace the abstract in the ambient: the other-wordly, the primal. The tracks in the following playlist reach for the lingering emptiness that can take seat within us, offering a moment of calm and exhale. Press play and let your thoughts unravel like folded laundry, let them breathe and wave in the wind of these synthesizers. This Sunday morning, peace is no longer quite so elusive, it breathes in these rhythms before us. 
   <br><br>
  The pleasure is ours to welcome [Curved Light](https://curvedlight.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape for a carefully curated selection that strives for introspective, transcendent, and even ethereal forms. Based in Atlanta, Curved Light releases music that border fourth world and psychedelic expressions of electronic and new age music.
</p>

# Curved Light's selection

## [Alice Coltrane](https://tomze.bandcamp.com/) – Hare Krishna (Universal Consciousness, 1971)
Curved Light: **"**I love all the complementing textures of this piece. If you only knew that the ensemble for this free jazz record included two simultaneous drummers and a string quartet, you'd never expect to hear a piece so sublime and transcendent, jubilant and ecstatic - a perfect way to rise with the sun.**"**

## [Tatsuro Yamashita](http://www.peterevanstrumpet.com/) – Ride on Time (Ride on Time, 1980)
Curved Light: **"**Clearly, the popularity of this song, and city pop as a whole, resonates so deeply with our current times. It so earnestly captures a feeling of nostalgia, yet was created as an artificial response to yesterday's pop - and now, we're rediscovering it through algorithms and other newly disseminated forms. Still, there's a reason this song remains relevant - it's a banger and really just gets ya movin'.**"**

## [Robin Guthrie](https://www.facebook.com/Jameszoomitchel/), Harold Budd – Flake
Curved Light: **"**This one is probably a better pick for a dreary Sunday morning, or after a late Saturday night. Its slow-moving current and masterful restraint lends itself to moody introspection, as expected of these brilliant artists - I could just listen to this one over and over.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Curved Light](https://curvedlight.bandcamp.com/) – One Moment in the Sun
Sarah: **"**Expansive and yet minimal, this track brings a tremendous sense of peace and healing, especially to Curved Light himself. Recorded during tumultuous times, the track served as a space for Curved Light to make his own moment of tranquility. The track's evolving arrangements of snyths wash over us like currents of sun rays. The analog synth halfway through must be what plants sound like when they think about growing tall :)**"**

## [36 & awakened souls](https://pitp.bandcamp.com/album/the-other-side-of-darkness) – Past Self
Sarah: **"**Coming off the 2021 album, [The Other Side of Darkness](https://pitp.bandcamp.com/album/the-other-side-of-darkness), this track's vocal texturing reaches into celestial expressions. Love the embrace of this ambient soundscape. Such subtle calm in this one, as well as the whole album.**"**

## [Triorität](https://trioritaet.bandcamp.com/album/alg0) – Bonopo
Sarah: **"**So many layers in this one, it feels like a floating dream of synths and jazz piano :) Organ currents lead and layer over each other, before clashing just as easily in a delightful heap of sound. This whole interaction is textured and grounded against the balance of organic percussion. The whirling wonderland of synths and chimes makes me forget any notion of time, as I imagine it may for you, too. The jazz percussion breaks by the midpoint are just as surprising as the piano takeover that brings us to the track's end.**"**

## [Gábor Szabó](https://www.discogs.com/artist/22851-Gabor-Szabo)– Fire Dance
Sarah: **"**This one comes off of my favorite Gábor Szabó album, [Dreams](https://lightintheattic.net/releases/6556-dreams) (1968). Such a phenomenal jazz-crossover; the album is a kaleidoscope of sound: Southeast Asian folk riffs melt together with Szabó's traditional Hungarian influences, all tied into soft-swaying samba movements that rock against African drums and the ever-evolving jazz structures that underlay them. Szabó's guitar effortlessly glides along the song's development, this whole track moves like silk.**"**
