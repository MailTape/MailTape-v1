# Diamanda La Berge Dramm's selection

## [Will Graefe](https://willgraefe.bandcamp.com/album/north-america) - North America nr. 2

**Diamanda La Berge Dramm**: **"**Will Graefe is a guitarist I went to school with who starting singing in recent years. I follow him because he tours with some of my favourite artists (eg Joan as Policewoman). His touch on the guitar is something I can’t quite describe, like a confidentiality - anyway, it’s a quality I aim for on the violin.**"**

## [caterina barbieri](https://caterinabarbieri.bandcamp.com/album/myuthafoo) - Math of You 

**Diamanda La Berge Dramm**: **"**caterina barbieri is an artist whose music I came across recently when I went to see the play EXTRA LIFE by Gisele Vienne. She wrote the music and it blew me away, so I’ve been listening to her since then.**"**

## [Luke Deane](https://lukedeane.today/Footsteps-On-The-Wall) - Changed

**Diamanda La Berge Dramm**: **"**Luke Deane is a really good friend, and this gorgeous track sums him up for me, as much as a piece of music could..**"**
