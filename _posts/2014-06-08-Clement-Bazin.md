<p id="introduction">
This morning, the french beatmaker [Clément Bazin](https://soundcloud.com/clembaz "Clément Bazin Soundcloud") will carry you on a sunny journey. Quietly first, his selection will then energize your morning, be ready...</p>

# From night thoughts to morning inspiration

With his [Night Things EP](http://withusrec.bandcamp.com/album/night-things-ep "Clément Bazin Night Things EP ") released on the label [With Us Record](https://soundcloud.com/withusrecords "With Us Record Soundcloud"), Clément Bazin explores night feelings in a dreamy and melodic way. The richness of his music sounds unique to us. Sometimes quiet, sometimes more pushy, his music should stick with you for a while, from night walks to morning wake up. 

# His morning selection

## Dimlite - Can't Get Used To Those
_Clément Bazin:_ **"**Dimlite is my favorite producer, this song is like a hip hop beat, a simple loop yet perfect that won't leave you for the rest of your sunday, there is always so much emotion and layer in each Dimlite track.**"**

## Flako - Lonely Town feat. Dirg Gerner
_Clément Bazin:_ **"**Dirg Gerner aka Flako is also a badboy, I love this Dirg Gerner project, beautiful song, beautiful lyrics. I guess we all feel that way from time to time and I guess it happens a lot to many producer, just staying alone for so much time making music, diging in your own mind.**"**

## Miguel - Do You… (Cashmere Cat Remix)
_Clément Bazin:_ **"**Cashmere cat always manage to do the cutest song, this one is perfect to kick yourself out of bed, clean a bit the bed room and start the day. this song feels good, especially after this 2 other tracks. I could have pick an other Cashmere cat tracks as they are always joyfull and perfect for this time of the day.**"**
