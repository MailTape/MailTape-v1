<p id="introduction">
This morning, we’ll start the day with a very aerial and bliss selection inspired by the french duo [Vendredi](https://www.facebook.com/vendredimusic "Check them on fb"). Each beat feeds our imagination, enlarging our vision. New landscapes, before hidden, now appears. Head in the sky, feet on the ground, let’s explore the world with an open heart like Jacques Tati used to.</p>

# Musicians and storytellers

With their debut EP, [Veneries Dies](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/veneris-dies-ep/id823647184 "Listen to it on iTunes"), [Vendredi](https://www.facebook.com/vendredimusic "Check them on fb") creates intriguing wild landscapes where majestuous trees have taken back their land over the ancient ruins of a previous civilisation. Oscillating between dreamy, bliss and trippy vibes, rare are the french artists who try to compete with the like of Flying Lotus and Amon Tobin. For this, we can only respect them and wish them the best.

# His morning inspiration

## Dimlite - Can't Get Used To Those
_Clément Bazin:_ **"**Dimlite is my favorite producer, this song is like a hip hop beat, a simple loop yet perfect that won't leave you for the rest of your sunday, there is always so much emotion and layer in each Dimlite track.**"**

## Flako - Lonely Town feat. Dirg Gerner
_Clément Bazin:_ **"**Dirg Gerner aka Flako is also a badboy, I love this Dirg Gerner project, beautiful song, beautiful lyrics. I guess we all feel that way from time to time and I guess it happens a lot to many producer, just staying alone for so much time making music, diging in your own mind.**"**

## Miguel - Do You… (Cashmere Cat Remix)
_Clément Bazin:_ **"**Cashmere cat always manage to do the cutest song, this one is perfect to kick yourself out of bed, clean a bit the bed room and start the day. this song feels good, especially after this 2 other tracks. I could have pick an other Cashmere cat tracks as they are always joyfull and perfect for this time of the day.**"**
