# Del Stephen's selection

Del Stephen: **"**Music continues to be a true source of joy in this life. I hope you continue to spend time discovering, learning about, and cherishing all of the artists out there who continue to make a sound while waiting to be found. They are everywhere and we need them! Thank you for finding me and thank you for inviting me to co-curate this playlist and to share my reflections.**"**


## Maria Alonzo's Goretti Group - Magnificat
Del Stephen: **"**Some of my very favourite songs are ones that I just cannot bring myself to listen to all the time. This dusty recording by Maria Alonzo's Goretti Group begins with a simple riff, and then, within the first 10 seconds, a totally mesmerizing voice begins to sing and I have little choice but to drop everything and listen. 

It is obviously an utmost devotional song, and a real love song at that, repeating its main sentiment throughout, but there is something about the quality of her voice when she offers that gift of patience ("I will wait for you") that really destroys me every time (in the best way). The song eventually comes to an end, as one might predict, with a gradual fade-out, but a rather mystifying one that leads us to wonder whether or not the person (or entity) she is waiting for ever arrives, or even if she has perhaps disappeared somewhere.

I thought I would leave you with a wonderful quote from Maria that I discovered one time while I was trying to find more information about this album: "If I can help somebody with a word or song then my living shall not be in vain".**"**

## Maximum Joy - Let It Take You
Del Stephen: **"**Oh yes! And right off the top, we are moving and grooving in some dub-infused goodness. The bass, the drums, that soaring violin (wow!), the guitar, the sax, am I forgetting anyone? 

The coming and going of the vocal lines paints a vivid scene on the dancefloor, or somewhere in the clouds, surrounded by only the best vibes. Depending on how I'm feeling, sometimes I hear a very blissful song that I can easily escape to, yet other times I listen and feel overwhelmed by a heaviness and a deep sense of longing for something that is not present at this moment. Either way, don't you love how much time we are afforded to get lost in this music? At times there is a sense that the song could go on forever, and it could, if you let it take you there...**"**
