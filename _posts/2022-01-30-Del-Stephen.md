<p id="introduction"> This morning, we're floating in the air with [Del Stephen](https://delstephen.bandcamp.com/). Coming from Toronto, his eclectic and blissful selection opens the doors to a magnificent Sunday. Warm and subtle, perfect to close this first month of the year (which has already been quiet intense !). Caring has never been so important and vital, see this episode as a heartful hug.

# Del Stephen's selection

Del Stephen: **"**Music continues to be a true source of joy in this life. I hope you continue to spend time discovering, learning about, and cherishing all of the artists out there who continue to make a sound while waiting to be found. They are everywhere and we need them! Thank you for finding me and thank you for inviting me to co-curate this playlist and to share my reflections.**"**


## Maria Alonzo's Goretti Group - Magnificat
Del Stephen: **"**Some of my very favourite songs are ones that I just cannot bring myself to listen to all the time. This dusty recording by Maria Alonzo's Goretti Group begins with a simple riff, and then, within the first 10 seconds, a totally mesmerizing voice begins to sing and I have little choice but to drop everything and listen. 

It is obviously an utmost devotional song, and a real love song at that, repeating its main sentiment throughout, but there is something about the quality of her voice when she offers that gift of patience ("I will wait for you") that really destroys me every time (in the best way). The song eventually comes to an end, as one might predict, with a gradual fade-out, but a rather mystifying one that leads us to wonder whether or not the person (or entity) she is waiting for ever arrives, or even if she has perhaps disappeared somewhere.

I thought I would leave you with a wonderful quote from Maria that I discovered one time while I was trying to find more information about this album: "If I can help somebody with a word or song then my living shall not be in vain".**"**

## Maximum Joy - Let It Take You
Del Stephen: **"**Oh yes! And right off the top, we are moving and grooving in some dub-infused goodness. The bass, the drums, that soaring violin (wow!), the guitar, the sax, am I forgetting anyone? 

The coming and going of the vocal lines paints a vivid scene on the dancefloor, or somewhere in the clouds, surrounded by only the best vibes. Depending on how I'm feeling, sometimes I hear a very blissful song that I can easily escape to, yet other times I listen and feel overwhelmed by a heaviness and a deep sense of longing for something that is not present at this moment. Either way, don't you love how much time we are afforded to get lost in this music? At times there is a sense that the song could go on forever, and it could, if you let it take you there...**"**

## Starlight Serenaders - Orange Wind
Del Stephen: **"**:']**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Del Stephen - Five Mountain Station
ImaCrea: **"**Del Stephen is like a painter drawing sonic landscapes to me. Choosing a track from his works asks for patience and lacher prise. Each are an opportunity to go for a walk in these intricate landscapes to admire so many details here and there. A kind of naturalist trip where man is just another being on earth, no more important than a plant or a rock, but no less either.**"**

## Apichatpong Weerasethakul - Mekong Hotel
ImaCrea: **"**These landscapes... it made me think about Apichatpong Weerasethakul's movies. Contemplative and subtle, his cinema tells stories like no other. The Thai director often use soundtracks which are incorporating sounds recorded in the actual landscape where action is happening. In such manner that everything perfectly mix together. We're here and now.**"**

## SRIRAJAH SOUND SYSTEM - SI PHAN DON LOVERS ROCK Feat.Molam Inteng Keawbuala
ImaCrea: **"**Let's stay in Thailand but, now, let's dance :)**"**

## Tiny Leaves - View From Here
Akira: **"**A music out of the deepest spot of sound that will relax you till you don't know what's real and fake. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**"**
