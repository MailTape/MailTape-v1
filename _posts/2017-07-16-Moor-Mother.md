<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome someone who has been on my wishlist for a while: Philadelphia-based interdisciplinary artist, Camae Ayewa ([Moor Mother](http://moormother.com/)).</p>
<p>Camae is co-founder and organiser of [Rockers! Philly](https://www.facebook.com/thegoodfolksatrockers), a 10-year long running event series and festival focused on marginalised musicians and artists spanning multiple genres of music. She has shared the stage with King Britt, Islam Chipsy, Claudia Rankine (whose latest book, [Citizen: An American Lyric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen:_An_American_Lyric), you should definitely read!) and bell hooks and opened on tour for [Screaming Females](http://www.screamingfemales.com/).</p>
<p>An important artist, among many, exposing the self-serving amnesia among a reigning elite about the historical crimes, revisionism and blustery denial that secure them their hegemony.</p>

# Moor Mother's selection


## Madam Data - Miniature Neurocosmos 28
_Moor Mother_: **"**Madam Data music is gentle and chaotic and I love this track, it really gets my mind moving.**"**

## Hprizm - Live @ Sons D'Hiver (Paris) 2014
_Moor Mother_: **"**Hprizm is one of my favorite producers and this track is just beautiful and creates a good morning vibe.**"**

## Kilamanzego - What happens when Eastern Europe and West Africa collide
_Moor Mother_: **"**Kilamanzego makes a lot of different vibes. This has great drums and fun vibe, this track gets me going in the morning.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## ᴠ̷̸ᴀ̷̸ɴ̷̸ɪ̷̸ʟ̷̸ʟ̷̸ᴀ̷̸ ̷̸ʜ̷̸ᴀ̷̸ᴍ̷̸ᴍ̷̸ᴇ̷̸ʀ̷̸ ft. Moor Mother - Murder
_Sanjay_: **"**After a hiatus just about as long as my entire lifetime, I was thrilled to hear that the ranters were back to perform their previously-shelved third album at London's Cafe OTO in 2016. Despite being recorded in 1985, [Return of the Ranters](http://music.normilhawaiians.com/) is a wonderful mixture of the eclectic, experimental and eccentric. This one, however, is a relative oldie but a goodie from 1982's [More Wealth than Money](https://www.discogs.com/Normil-Hawaiians-More-Wealth-Than-Money/release/685372)LP. Wistful, healing and just enough melancholy for a Sunday morning...**"**

## Aybee - What is
_Sanjay_: **"**[Les Filles de Illighadad](https://www.facebook.com/Illighadad/) are a group from the village of Illighadad in the region of Abalak; a world far away from WiFi where the suns’ passage, the movement of the animals and the sound of the crickets measures the length of the day. They present a curious and original approach to two very different sides of Tuareg music – dreamy ishumar acoustic guitar sessions, and the hypnotic polyphonic tende drum (submerged in water for much of their performances!) that inspires it. This is subtle yet deeply personal music.**"**

## Rafeef Ziadah - Shades of Anger
_Sanjay_: **"**Another musician who still sounds incredibly fresh all these many decades later. Produced in 1979, 'Survival' sounds like a beat poetry dissertation on the state of the world. A rap from the here and now about the here and now.**"**

## Matana Roberts - Raise the Roof: Information, Class & Greed Besmirch Democracy
_Sanjay_: **"**There aren't many MailTape issues I've been involved in that don't feature a release from the brilliant [Constellation Records](http://cstrecords.com/) in Montréal. And this is unliklely to be the last – despite me wearing down the wax on this particular album since its release in 2001. 'Good words! strong words! words that could move mountains!'**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today! Thanks to [Camae Ayewa](http://moormother.com/) for her selections and to [Anaïs Caura](http://cargocollective.com/anaiscaura) for this episode's superb illustration.</p>
