<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome [Muddy Monk](https://soundcloud.com/sissel) to MailTape.
<br><br>
Today's selection, however, trades in a joyous aqueous sound—with plenty of mallards, dolphin squeaks and alternating compressions.</p>


# Muddy Monk's selection

## Ploy – =O
_Muddy Monk_: **"**Celui-ci sombre pour les réveils dramatiques...**"**

## [Kali Malone](http://kalimalone.com/) – Locus of Repetition
_Muddy Monk_: **"**Celui-là doux pour les réveils à deux**"**

## Mar-llena – Monorepos
_Muddy Monk_: **"**Et celui-ci pour les jours heureux**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Muddy Monk – Drift
_Sanjay_: **"**A brutally reduced minimal techno mover with a writhing acid line and spherical sound design that leaves all clichés behind and just does the job.**"**

## [Beatrice Dillon](http://www.dillonwork.com/) – Carrier and Mask
_Sanjay_: **"**Computerised, dubbed out percussion and samples meld with guitars, wah tubes, bass, pianet, and the percussive world of snare drum experiments and rhythmic balafon. Understated and playful.**"**

## Akiko Kiyama – Gabriel
_Sanjay_: **"**[Akiko Kiyama](http://akikokiyama.com/) is a classically trained musician turned electronic music composer. I think she has a knack for magnificently slinky, trippy music. Synths twitch anxiously over a booming kick-drum and the bounce here is paranoid but playful.**"**

## Afrikan Sciences – 43
_Sanjay_: **"**No stranger to MailTape, Eric Douglas Porter picked some Sunday morning tunes for us alongside Gaël Segalen as [Les Graciés](https://www.mailta.pe/319/les-gracies/) back in July. As [Afrikan Sciences](https://soundcloud.com/afrikan-sciences), however, Eric's study of rhythm fixates on the oddities—the mutations, the dualities and instances of bare collision.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Sissel Wincent](https://soundcloud.com/sissel) for her Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
