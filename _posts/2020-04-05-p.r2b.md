<p id="introduction">This morning, it’s our 400th episode and the gravitational pull of the musical universe is strong, compelling us to wake up all our senses and emotions, our entire minds and acuities. Let’s fully inhabit the spaces that we find ourselves confined in, grounding and charging ourselves ready to release energy through a beautiful and spontaneous moment of contact improvisation.

Both P.R2B’s music and selection are vibrant reminders that music is the perfect medium through which we can find more freedom than limits, at all times and in all places. Our newly domestic geography may be full of modification and compromise, yet in it we can still encounter mysteries. Tangled clouds of hope and grief seem to make for a blurry and uncertain distance, but in love and solidarity, we’re going to ride out towards it together.

Océan Forever, the latest release from P.R2B, is available to listen and watch right now.

# P.R2B's selection

## Kanye West - Feel the love

P.R2B: **"**When I listened to Feel the love for the first time, I was shocked by the production of the track.
It begins just with the vocals and the bass and it seems like the song will be only that. But at 1’08, the miracle happens. We hear tribal drums with screams. It moves me for it sounds like a scream of rebellion.**"**

## Christophe - Dangereuse

P.R2B: **"**This track is one of my favorite songs by Christophe. I adore the lyrics. I love his way of telling us about tiny details of life and making poetry out of them.
One of my favorite sentences is “13h, trésor, des mouvements délicats”
Christophe is a maestro of intimacy. Every time I hear a track of his, it seems like he’s just close to us in the night.
I love the opening of the track with the strings. It reminds me of the soundtracks in Hitchcock’s movies. The love song is like a thriller film.**"**

## Ella Jenkins - Wake up, little sparrow

P.R2B: **"**I love folk music. My father was a big fan of Mississippi John Hurt and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.
Listening to folk music has the same effect on me than the feeling of coming home. Even if it’s not my home or my culture. But it’s like the essence of things.
The song Wake up, little sparrow is a perfect example of that. It’s a song for children. I love everything about that track, the fragility of the recording, that tender guitar, the simplicity of the lyrics, and among these the soul of Ella Jenkins’ voice. It brings tears every time.**"**
