<p id="introduction"> This morning, I introduce you to [Maud Octallinn](https://maudoctallinn.bandcamp.com/), a french psych-pop singer. Her first album is a compilation of failed love songs. But it’s easy to fall in love with each song. Her beautiful impish voice is perfect to sing on her surrealistic lyrics full of metaphors. </p>

# Nursery rhymes for adults

She’s revealing a complete and complexe universe. Thanks to [La Souterraine](http://souterraine.biz/) to help impressive artists such Maud Octallinn record their album and spread it to the world. Her [Mosltamouraté](https://maudoctallinn.bandcamp.com/album/mostlamourat-e) is an UFO.

The intro song called « Chez le Boucher » is recorded as a medieval troubadour would do it, then an organ plays song heard in some vintage funfair in Paris. Recorded in 1 week at home, it’s a very instinctive concept album and successful DIY project. 

# Maud's selection:

## For a  mystic Sunday

## Midget ! - Les Remparts

Maud Octalinn : "A song from Midget ! extract from their second album « Bois et Charbon », a masterpiece introduced by Sing Sing (singer of Arlt). I’ll never forget our first met, it was at my first concert as Maud Octallinn at Olympic café. I was in the backstage, paralyzed, while all my friends were waiting for me in the concert hall with their kindly smiles. Mocke looked me in the eye and he made a speech that really motivated me-on. Now I often think about it before going on stage."

## For a Hangover Sunday

## Hyperclean - Gainsbourg

Maud Octalinn :  "A Hyperclean song from their album « Grand Tata ». Frédéric Jean is kind of a Godfather for the musical pool of Toulouse, even of the entire french crazy-pop. I dedicated him a secret cult. His not-always-sweet madness is very familiar for me, he’s kind of comforting brother. I’ve meet him once in Paris (at Olympic café again). He was on stage with Julien Gasc who I was up on stage time to a duo."

## For a bedtime Sunday

## François de Roubaix - Tempo

Maud Octalinn : "This track from Nino Ferrer who I wanted to put it in these selection wasn’t on Soundcloud, for I’ve picked up this one from François de Roubaix. Especially for this inimitable Wurlitzer’s sound and those cheesey percussions. I admire controversy jazzman who have always brushed against bad taste. The music of François, such as Nino’s music, can’t be resumed, it is reveal to you methodically, period by period, and reveals a strong character, complex and timeless."

<p id="outroduction">
That's all folks, thanks to Maud Octallinn for her greatness, Celestin for the amazing artwork (once again), and Amandine Hanse-Balssa for the original photography. See you next sunday ! </p>
