# Postcards's selection

## Big Thief - Cattails
Postcards: **"**One of those songs we feel we’ve known forever. Adrienne’s lyrics are always beautifully written - here she talks about death with a serenity that’s reassuring.**"**

## Animale Colective - Banshee Beat
Postcards: **"**A gorgeous, subtle track that builds up without ever falling into clichés. That first chord change is one of our favorite musical moments.**"**

## Velvet Underground - Pale Blue Eyes
Postcards: **"**The song needs no introduction... Sunday Morning would've been the expected choice but this is one of our favorites VU songs, especially the fluid, never-ending guitar riff that glues the song together.**"**
