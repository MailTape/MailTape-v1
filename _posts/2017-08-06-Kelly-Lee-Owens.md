# Kelly Lee Owens's selection

## Alice Coltrane - Journey In Satchidananda
_Kelly Lee Owens_: **"**The bass!!! My god! And the harp of course... just wow! A track every one should have heard. I usually listen to this on repeat in the dark.**"**

## Cocteau Twins - Wax & Wane 
_Kelly Lee Owens_: **"**It's SO hard to choose one track from Cocteau Twins as it's safe to say they are one of my favouite bands. Liz's voice! Distorted bass lines ! Drum Machine ! So much atmosphere !
I love how the vocals are used abstractly at times - the "lyrics" are shaped by what sounds Liz feels she needs to make in reaction to the music - it's so pure.**"**

## Aphex Twin - Acrid Avid Jam Shred 
_Kelly Lee Owens_: **"**I love pretty much every track he's ever made - his production is insane! His tracks could have been made a week ago - he's always been so ahead of everyone else in the game. I'm looking forward to seeing him at Primevera this year!**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Kelly Lee Owens — Anxi. ft. Jenny Hval
_Louise_: **"**I saw Kelly Lee Owens live, her set was so sharp and awesome! Her music resonated in me during the show. I was really glad to get to see her on stage. Kelly Lee Owens' album is deep and pure after several listen where I was amazed by her word, I had to feature her in a MailTape episode!**"**

## Peggy Gou - Gou Talk
_Louise_: **"**I'm still discovering a lot of women creating electronic music. It makes me so happy! Peggy Gou is a Berlin based Korean artist and this song of hers is so damn cool. There's a funky vibes in the melody and the bass is heavy. It makes me wanna dance!**"**

## Supernaive - Open Waltz
_Louise_: **"**Supernaive is a band I discovered thanks to [Shaelone](https://www.mailta.pe/232/shaelone/ "Shaelone's MailTape episode") — who was our guest a few months back! They are two brothers from Paris, really driven by the Japanese culture. I love their first EP _Dazed & Confused_ and I knew they would be perfect for this MailTape episode.**"**

## Sophia Kennedy - Build Me A House
_Louise_: **"**Sophia Kennedy's voice! How good is that?! I loved this song, the minute I heard it. The piano is so damn good too. I really dig it!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks. A big thanks to [Kelly Lee Owens](https://www.facebook.com/kellyleeowens/) for being our guest this morning, thanks to [Pierre-Julien](http://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for his amazing artwork of today's episode and Daisy for her great writing!</p>
