<p id="introduction">This morning, fly off from the Scandinavian Arctic towards space. We head to the mysterious new planet in our solar system. In the hope to find the interplanetary music on the ninth planet. Yet unnamed, I solemnly proposes to name it in tribute to the man who had perhaps discovered it before anyone else : Hans-Peter Lindstrøm. It's the only answer to explain how great is his Space-Disco. </p>

# To infinity ... and Beyond

Push play, close your eyes, and let the music flood your imagination. And there is where it all begin...

In a galaxy far far away, where spaceships are loyal steeds and battles are won with sound waves, King ARP-2600 reign on the Great Analogic planet. Minimoog Voyager, leader of the Glorious Guardians, devoted servants of The Holy Groove and Electrical Harmony, protect the Analogic King from the dark sovereign  Bontempi AZ-9000. Who swear on his connections to bring down his great contender... 

As a child who play with his toys, creates universes, stories, heroes, bad guys, Lindstrom make music. Each track, creating his own mythology. It's up to us to go through his waves and discover his Analogic Galaxy. 

Since the dawn of time, rhythm of days in this specific Galaxy is governed by the BPMs of Disco-Masters. As Long they're playing, everything is supposed to going well. The rhythms are accelerating at nightfall, and slow at dawn. That's the first rule. This frail harmony is broken when the princess Korg PS-3100, Queen of all Disco-Masters, is kidnapped by the diabolical Bontempi AZ-9000. Minimoog Voyager and his Glorious Guardians begans a journey through time and space to found the missing princess...



# The Lindstrøm's summer space opera soundtrack
 
## Oma & Amberflame - Lazy Sun
Hans-Peter Lindstrøm: " _Great harp-drenched version of the 2007 AN-2 summertime anthem to extend your summer!_ "

## Michael David - Ohana
H-P L.: "_Totally awesome balearic spacey 80-s boogie track from Michael David of LA Classixx. Nice bouncy bass and dx-keys!_"

## Crackazat - Eye Light
H-P L.: " _Amazing track from a band I know nothing about. Jazz-soul chords with a nice swing makes this a no-brainer._“
