<p id="introduction">This morning, discover [Pavane](https://www.facebook.com/pavane.music), a young and talented musician whose inspiration is fed by nature. Filled with 6 blissful tracks spiced up with a rough one, this selection will put you in the best conditions to fly over the vast land of your imagination. Forget the seatbelt and simply let the music projects its scenery onto the screen of your closed eyelids.</p>

# Pavane, the free bird.

Moved by a great ambition without forgeting to stay humble, Pavane released a stunning debut album called '[L'échapée](https://eumolpe.bandcamp.com/album/l-chapp-e)'. Coming from the classical music scene, he started to experiment with electronic more recently. His music is the result of a deep maturity where violon strings and piano chords are delightfully melted with electronic waves. Think about it as Nils Frahm meets Rone. 

Clearly inspired by nature, Pavane takes us in his universe where a flock of flamingos fly in the sky with the grace of a ballet. Their reflect on the lake below mixed with the subtle light of the sunrise triggers a truly blissful moment.

# Pavane’s morning inspiration
 
## Blutch - A
_Pavane:_ **"**A young producer from Rennes, the city where I growed up. Soft and tender feelings. I love the cutting and the selection of samples : the little harp and the strings, and this fat kick over it !**"**
 
## Jono McCleery - ‘Ballade’
_Pavane:_ **"**The sample at the beginning is a piece of Debussy (Ballade). I’m very familiar with this music, i recognized it immediately. The evolution of the track surprised me in a good sense, but the moment I prefer, it’s when there is the piano, mmmmh !!!**"**
 
## Floating Points - Nuits Sonore
_Pavane:_ **"**It sounds so good ! I’m impressed by the mastery of time : it is rare that a track of 12mn captivate me like that, from the beginning to the end. It’s probably due to the effects and saturation playing, which is so live. Play it loud on a good sound system to appreciate dynamics and sound warmth !!**"**
