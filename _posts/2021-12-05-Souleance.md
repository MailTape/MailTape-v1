# Souleance' selection

## José Gonzalez - Line of Fire
Souleance: **"**What and Artist this guy is . For A A Sunday mood I will pick almost any track of José Gonzales, his sense of poetry is unique, this one from his last album looks so simple and yet it’s beautiful.**"**

## Eddie Chacon - My Mind is Out of its Mind
Souleance: **"**Discovered with the very talented John Caroll Kirby (Stonesthrow Records)
we just love Ediie’s crooner’s voice and his magical sound throughout his album.
Known in the 80’s for hit Hit “Would I lie to you” under the alias of Charles & Eddie, he has just made an Lp called “Pleasure, Joy and Happiness” that we strongly recommend with a good Hi-fi sound system, a good glass of wine or a good Cocktail.**"**

## Frank Ocean - Cayendo
Souleance: **"**The powerful ans Subltle atmosphere of this tune makes us feel like we are in a road movie. It just makes you Float.**"**
