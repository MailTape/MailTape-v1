<p id="introduction"> This morning, the cold freezes our minds and the rain makes us feel bad. Fortunately, to chase away all its negative waves, we have the selection of the group [Souleance](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/). Smoothie, sunshine and good vibes in abundance to counter this winter that is fast approaching.
<br><br>
[Souleance](https://www.facebook.com/souleance/),It’s the association between producer Fulgeance and Dj Soulist. A nice mix that leads to an energetic and solar music mixing Afro-tropical, hip-hop, soul rhythms . . . So much possibility that the band manages to surprise us with every EP release. Their latest, “[Les Mouches](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/album/les-mouches)”, released in May 2020, is a return to the roots of machines and funk.

# Souleance' selection

## [José Gonzalez](http://jose-gonzalez.com/) - Line of Fire
Souleance: **"**What and Artist this guy is . For A A Sunday mood I will pick almost any track of José Gonzales, his sense of poetry is unique, this one from his last album looks so simple and yet it’s beautiful.**"**

## [Eddie Chacon](https://eddiechacon.com/) - My Mind is Out of its Mind
Souleance: **"**Discovered with the very talented [John Caroll Kirby](https://johncarrollkirby.com/) ([Stonesthrow Records](https://www.stonesthrow.com/)) we just love Eddie’s crooner’s voice and his magical sound throughout his album. Known in the 80’s for hit Hit “Would I lie to you” under the alias of Charles & Eddie, he has just made an Lp called “Pleasure, Joy and Happiness” that we strongly recommend with a good Hi-fi sound system, a good glass of wine or a good Cocktail.**"**

## [Frank Ocean](https://blonded.co/) - Cayendo
Souleance: **"**The powerful ans Subltle atmosphere of this tune makes us feel like we are in a road movie. It just makes you Float.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Souleance - Mont Maudit
Anaïs G: **"**I discovered Souleance in 2013, with their album “[La Beat Tape](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/album/la-beat-tape)” and their title “[Californie](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/album/la-beat-tape)”, a musical gem that makes you want to bask in the sun and where sensuality is king. Since this album, I have been following this duo composed of [Soulist](https://www.facebook.com/soulistofficial/) and [Fulgeance](https://www.facebook.com/fulgeancebeats/) very closely. Lately they surprised us with Reunion covers with “[P’it Séga](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/album/pti-sega-ep)” but especially with the release of their latest EP “[Les Mouches](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/album/les-mouches)”, under the label [First Word Records](http://www.firstwordrecords.com/). Even though it was "[Aquarelle](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/album/les-mouches)" that we listened to the most, "[Mont Maudit](https://souleance.bandcamp.com/album/les-mouches)" is one of my favorites.**"**

## [BadBadNotGood](https://badbadnotgood.bandcamp.com/) - Confessions PT II Feat [Colin Stetson](https://www.colinstetson.com/)
Anaïs G: **"**Let’s stay in the madness and passion of music with another band, BadBadNotGood. A rather jazzy, groovy and crazy title, discovered recently, that totally surprised me and took me to other worlds, as they know how to do so well.**"**

## [Caribou](https://soundcloud.com/caribouband) - Magpie 
Anaïs G: **"**We’re going down a notch into madness with Caribou. A mastered electronic music, sweetness and freshness, Canadian Dan Snaith surprises us once again in his latest album “[Suddendly](https://soundcloud.com/caribouband/sets/suddenly-47811653)” by his musical grandeur.**"**

##  [Sampa the Great](https://www.sampathegreat.com/) - Rhymes To The East 
Anaïs G: **"**We finish with the great Sampa The Great, with a rap title but not too much, just to settle for the end of this colorful selection, sunny and full of good vibes.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for listening with us. So much love to Souleance for the delightful Sunday selections and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
