<p id="introduction"> This morning, we're feeling fantastic. The days are getting longer, summer is almost here and life is gradually resuming. We discover resources, qualities and desires hitherto unsuspected that we now long to explore. It is with a new eye that we now wish to glimpse the future, the one of a sensitive, complex and caring alter-ego.
<br><br>
[Fantastic Twins](https://fantastictwins.bandcamp.com/) is one of Julienne Dessagne's alter-ego through which the French, Berliner by adoption, draws a rich musical universe, synthesis of various electronic influences. When I saw her play live the first time, I was immediately moved by the swooping vocal textures and the melodies influenced by her knowledge of dance music which results in a constant oscillation between dark and light.

# Michal Turtle's selection

## Gaussian Curve – Impossible Island
Michal Turtle: **"**<alarm> For me a perfect first wake-up song. I first became aware of Gaussian Curve after I was signed to the same label, and spent many happy listening hours with them both live and on vinyl. You can hear the sunrise so clearly on this track, with early morning interjections from whatever wildlife happens to be around you.**"**

## Jon Hassell – Dream Theory
Michal Turtle: **"**<Snooze button> The ultimate snooze song. The inevitability of the minimalism is stunning, and the way it appears out of the previous track and goes on for another 6 minutes is one of the most beautiful moments I know of. Add one of the dopest baselines of all time, and slowly come to full consciousness.**"**

## Meredith Monk – Turtle Dreams (Waltz)
Michal Turtle: **"**<repeat Snooze button> Now you really have to get up, and this is the perfect track. Soothing, beautiful and ugly all at the same time, seems to redefine what beauty is. An unrelenting ostinato organ drones through the whole piece, and with four extraordinary voices a new reality and universe is created. As it is sometimes said: “wake up and smell the coffee”.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Michal Turtle - Feel the Pain
Sanjay: **"**This is one of [Fantastic Twins](https://fantastictwins.bandcamp.com/album/collected-twins-1)' older songs but one of my favourites. After an introduction which sounds like the soundtrack of a mysterious western and takes us to the heart of an immense desert plain, Julienne Dessagne tells us the legend of two flying twins lost in the vastness of the sky.**"**

## Hilsa – Wash
Sanjay: **"**Taken from "Zoom", Thessa Torsing’s first full-length album as [upsammy](https://upsammy.bandcamp.com/) to be released in June 2020, this track makes me think of Aphex Twin's music. Its aerial tones and birdsonglike melodies remind me of long summer afternoons, with these complex drum patterns evoking the flow of a river in which we bathe under a blazing sun.**"**

## Tomeka Reid and Alexander Hawkins - Albert Ayler (His Life Was Too Short)
Sanjay: **"**With this deep rolling bass line [Giraffi Dog](https://www.facebook.com/giraffidog/) brings us back to urban and technological landscapes, until the middle of the track which sounds like an opening towards the sky and this melancholic conclusion with its dreamy choirs and soul-stirring synths which always moves me.**"**

## Anarchist Mountains – Lift
Sanjay: **"**While [Perel](https://perelmusic.bandcamp.com/)'s dub version of her song "Die Dimension" is perfect for Saturday night out, this house remix by [Jayda G](https://jaydag.bandcamp.com/) has the sweetness and the rhythm you need for a slow awakening and recovering from your hangover in the sunlight.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to Michal Turtle for his Sunday selections, and to [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr/) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
