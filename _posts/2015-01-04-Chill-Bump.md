<p id="introduction">
This morning, let's dance and celebrate 2015 to the selection of the powerful duo [Chill Bump](http://www.chill-bump.com "Chill Bump's website").</p>
 
# Uplifting music

With their first album _Ego Trip_, Chill Bump has proved that the best is yet to come. Their hip-hop is influenced by so many inspirations that you can identify it in their tracks if you pay attention. Each time you listen to one of their songs, you will discover a new sound you didn't hear before, a new punchline you didn't notice before.
 
# Chill Bump's morning inspiration
 
## Flight of the Conchords - Foux Du Fafa
_Chill Bump:_ **"**You should bump this track while you're wearing an apron and cooking eggs for your girlfriend on a sunday morning. Sing along, dance and act retarded. You may even learn a bit of pointless french.**"**
 
## Nate Dogg - I Got Love
_Chill Bump:_ **"**Usually, people are more or less hungover on a sunday morning. This track should help you smile, get back up on your feet and enjoy yourself. Nate Dogg´s voice could bring sunshine to any rainy day. RIP...**"**
 
## James Blake - Retrograde
_Chill Bump:_ **"**This track is for all the people who like to have a lie in on a sunday.**"**
