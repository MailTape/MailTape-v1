<p id="introduction">
  This morning, we're serving you a comfy episode. A selection curated with great care for a chill morning at home spent alone or with your loved ones sipping a warm hot chocolate. From blues, to bossa nova, Bowie's vibes and amapiano, we're honored to share this episode with [Natalie Greffel](https://nataliegreffel.bandcamp.com/) as our dear guest.
</p>

# Natalie Greffel's selection

## Donny Hathaway - A Song for You
Natalie Greffel: **"**I've consciously and actively been thinking about the practices of love lately and how within that, trust is the foundation of intimacy. This has lead me down paths of looking for rituals and ceremonious way of creating a culture and practice of trust beginning with the self. This song almost painfully reminds me to wake up remembering to take time to listen, support, honor and be encouraging towards myself. But most impotantly, to say "I love you" to myself.**"**

## Kasper Staub Trio - People Who Love Each Other
Natalie Greffel: **"**This Danish trio, offers me soo much space to not think, but instead lose myself into wordless simplicity. And I emotionally feel very quietly stimulated by the impressions they offer.**"** 

## Johnny Alf - Rapaz de BEM
Natalie Greffel: **"**I just love Bossa Nova and have listened alot to Bossa Nova in the morning, this is one of the unrecognized founders and piorneers of Bossa Nova, a black gay man called Johnny Alf. I want to listen more to him since I recently read about him.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Natalie Greffel - Toquei
ImaCrea: **"**When I discovered [Natalie Greffel](https://nataliegreffel.bandcamp.com)'s album Para Todos, I felt a "madeleine de Proust" moment. Her delicate bossa nova music brought me back souvenirs of my childhood listening to music from Brazil in the car with my parents on our way to the beach on summer holidays. It's such a pleasure to see this genre reactivated nowadays. Natalie's tour de force here is in being able to actualize it in 2020's and in no falling into nostalgic kitsch repetitiveness.**"**

## [Deborah Dery](https://backl.ink/62040721) - Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most (cover)(quarantine version)
ImaCrea: **"**Smooth waves from Tel Aviv under the lockdown. Beautiful rare gem here.**"**

## [Emel](https://emel.bandcamp.com) - The Man Who Sold the World 
ImaCrea: **"**We keep on with another beautiful voice here coming from New York. Make sure to listen to her full album, exceptionnal work here.**"**

## [Teno Afrika](https://tenoafrika.bandcamp.com/album/amapiano-selections) - Lerato La Bass
ImaCrea: **"**A fun and groovy beat in pure amapiano style. Funky fresh from South of Africa. Move that body yes!**"**
