<p id="introduction">This week we are happy to welcome [Tsembla](https://marjaahti.com/) to MailTape. She provides us with an artful juxtaposition of the eerily off kilter and a sense of weightlessness in her musical selections this morning. Based in Turku, Finland, Tsembla is the solo alias of musician Marja Ahti, a frequent collaborator of the [Kemialliset Ystävät](https://kemiallisetystavat.bandcamp.com/) musical collective and one half of the electro-acoustic duo [Ahti & Ahti](https://marjaahti.com/ahti-ahti/).
<br><br>
As Tsembla, Marja creates vivid, imaginative compositions of sound and rhythm using electronics and treated samples of recorded acoustic instruments, objects, voices, feedback, and environmental sounds.
<br><br>
Woodwinds, strings, percussion and ancient sounds from all corners of the earth are electronically synthesized to create unpredictable textural twists and turns. A perfect episode for when you're spending time outdoors, performing your daily rituals, cleaning or just pottering about.</p>


# Tsembla's selection

## Tomoko Sauvage – Clepsydra
_Tsembla_: **"**Early morning or late night music. Rise at dawn, open a window.**"**

## Anne Guthrie – Branching Low And Spreading
_Tsembla_: **"**A conversation between loose acoustic instrumentation, beating tunings, processed field sounds and spaces. The track is from the album [Codiaeum Variegatum](http://studentsofdecay.com/post/59038637275/anne-guthrie-codiaeum-variegatum), themed after a species of toxic plant. A truly brilliant album as a whole.**"**

## Raul Lovisoni & Francesco Messina – Prati Bagnati Del Monte Analogo
_Tsembla_: **"**This wonderful album from 1979 was reissued by [Die Schachtel](http://www.dieschachtel.com/) a few years ago and is one of the most played Sunday morning records in our household.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Tsembla – Gravitating Bones
_Sanjay_: **"**Get lost in the oneiric circuits and transistors of Marja's synthesizer in this track. The pace is not immediately recognisable, yet I feel there is a centre keeping it all together just slightly outside the field of hearing.**"**

## Irene Buckley – October
_Sanjay_: **"**The possibilities and opportunities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. This is a soothing musical accompaniment from [Irene Buckley](http://www.irenebuckley.com/) to the shorter daylight hours, bountiful harvests, autumnal foilage and grey skies.**"**

## Laurel Halo – Raw Silk Uncut Wood
_Sanjay_: **"**A wonderfully tranquil mesh of woodwind, early electronic music gestures, and almost funeral organ from [Laurel Halo](http://www.laurelhalo.com/)'s latest LP of the same name.**"**

## Nadia Struiwigh – Roeiweijk
_Sanjay_: **"**Lovely downtempo and ambient vibes from [Nadia Struiwigh](https://www.nadiastruiwigh.com/) to end this episode. Flirting with ambient techno, the drones and spaced out pads work well in slow, drawn out movements here.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thanks so much for listening and lots of love and respect to [Marja Ahti](https://marjaahti.com/) for her selection, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for this beautiful illustration!</p>
