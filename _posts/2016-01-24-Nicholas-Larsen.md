<p id="introduction">This morning, let’s play a bit with this untamed selection from our guest [Nicholas Larsen](https://soundcloud.com/nicholas-larsen). It won’t be without a few head nods that you will find his choices are sparked with the very same hints of his own sounds. Buzzed from these tracks you will be, and his own is a new kind of groove you have yet to dance to. We’ve made it clear we were back last week, but today’s Mailtape is just a reminder of the excellence of music we strive to share. Sunday mornings are here to stay, and today, your eardrums will be at ease with the only resolution you should stick to; music’s a must everywhere I go.</p>

# Silver rain and copper chips


We don’t want to press too hard on the importance of earnestness, but it’s kind of hard to imagine anything but oceans and waves drifting afar with rays of sunlight piercing your shades when listening to ‘’Bleu Toucan’’. It’s true what they say, the French do have a way of incorporating romance into anything they touch and make. ‘’Vendredi sur Mer’’ is reminiscent of this trip you’ve long to take during the harsh winter months. A cruise on the Venice beach sidewalk on your favorite pair of wheels, a stroll in a Californian city letting its early evening warm winds calm your inner tensions. And if you’ve never been to Santa Monica or LA , just sit back, relax and let this track teach you the best of the west coast vibe.

But we all know the states isn’t just fun in the sun and silk slacks. It’s been a while since I hit the repeat button with so much enthusiasm than for this track. Now, I’m not saying I belong to the badass kind of people who could ride and die till the gas runs dry, but Jimmy Edgar’s ‘’’ You know what it is’’ sure makes me gain cool points in gangster attitude. This track is the ultimate combo of force and smoothness. That Detroit, in your face ‘’I ain’t fucking around and you know it’’ kind of attitude, for all you soft peers needing a little boost in your ego drops, take it or leave it, I just can’t stop playing it.

We keep it flowing with this ultimate collaboration of artist and beat makers. Seems we’re ready for more sleeve rolling, knee dropping, elbow digging jamming with ‘’Blakkst Skn’'. Weird title I know, but that choice parallels the originality of a track that lays between hardcore and chill.

Getting to the heart of it, things are making more sense. Nicholas Larsen’s Starlight explains his musical choices perfectly. Fantastic discovery, his soul-like flow is packed with confidence and assurance. His heart-throbbing voice pounding on those sweet lyrics is simply decadent. A good partner for an early Sunday dance stroll in your crib with or without company, I think it’s fair to say Larsen not only has great taste but is a slamming talent himself, to enjoy and consume without restriction.

Full of surprises we are and that’s why you love us isn’t it? We all live for originality and a good musical challenge, at least I do. And that’s why we bring you ‘’Silver Firs’’ by Signal, a new genre of music straight out of Switzerland that honestly takes a bit of an open mind, and ear, to appreciate. It isn’t your casual, usual, I know what’s going to happen on the next beat kind of track. No, ‘’Signals’’ is an interesting mix of pop vocals and instrumental madness. Indie is not dead and this group sure confirms it. Watch at for them I’d say, I think they have that little something special that often equals success. Carrying on with this ‘’Oh So British’’ track by Daniel Alexander. ‘’Trains’’ holds up his title with pride and affirmation. Reminds me of the Fink vocals I cherished for so long but with even more decadence. Enjoy that and pass it on to your best friend. That’s not all for today, we bring on a bit of tempo and fierce joy that’s guaranteed to get you dancing, grooving to the pace of Frankey & Sandrino’s Acamar, I need say no more than this; Can’t wait till the next gathering so I can pop that one out and slide into another weekend of partying. Enjoy!

# Nicholas's inspiring selection :
 
## Bleu Toucan - LA feat. Vendredi sur Mer
Nicholas: **"**So, Bleu Toucan are a french duo who are pushing their "electropical" sound. This song is just a great vibe; it reminds me of cruising around LA - which the song is named after! Definitely worth checking out some of there other stuff.**"**

## Jimmy Edgar - Feel What It Is
Nicholas:**"**I stumbled across this tune by chance, and it's casually q gangster. Just when you think ah shit maybe this is sick but gonna get boring, there's this really rad arpeggiated line which comes in and makes you feel like a boss. I think this is a bit of a tangent from what the guy, Jimmy Edgar, makes - but it's smooth!**"**

## Rejjie Snow - Blakkst Skn feat. Rae Morris
Nicholas: **"**Maybe this is a bit heavy for a Sunday morning, but fuck it - it's super original! Rejjie is killing it atm, and Kaytranada too - the tune he did for The Internet, 'Girl', is so banging also... Anyway, hope you enjoy!**“**
