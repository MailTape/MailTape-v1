<p id="introduction">This morning, we are thrilled to welcome [Mini Trees](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) to host the first MailTape episode of September! 

Based in Los Angeles, [Mini Trees](https://minitrees.bandcamp.com) is the solo project of Lexi Vega. Her music is vibrant with emotional exploration. Mini Trees creates a raw lyrical atmosphere where she lays bare her experiences in a challenging and vulnerable way. On top of this, Mini Trees pairs this emotionally candid quality with a dreamy undercurrent. Listening to her second EP **Slip Away** feels like walking through the galleries of her very thoughts.

# Mini Trees selection

## [Porches](https://porchesmusic.com/) - Do U Wanna
Mini Trees: **"**Porches has been on repeat for the last few months. Love their last record Ricky Music and this track is one that I keep going back to. It’s dancey and catchy and makes you a little sad; my favorite combo.**"**

## [Lomelda](https://lomelda.bandcamp.com/) - Out There
Mini Trees: **"**I’ve been revisiting this album a lot lately and this is probably my favorite track off of it. Absolutely love Lomelda’s melodies, and lyrically feels very relevant to quarantine.**"** 

## [Ásgeir](https://www.asgeirmusic.com/) - Trust
Mini Trees: **"**This is also not a new song, but I was supposed to see Asgeir in LA with my friend right before quarantine and we ended up backing out because of coronavirus. I'm actually not sure if the concert was canceled or not, but either way I'm sad to have missed out and have been listening to Ásgeir a lot. This is a beautiful song and is a comforting listen amidst all of this.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Mini Trees](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) – Honestly
Sarah: **"**This song is part of the new EP released by Mini Trees, and I replayed it over and over as soon as I heard it. There's a hint of the Sufjan Stevens influence she talks of, but Mini Trees departs into a style completely her own. Honestly creates an absolutely mesmerizing harmony of soaring vocals backed with effortless guitar melodies. Her lyrics detail a deeply intricate emotional analysis, something that stands out about Mini Trees music as a whole. The song builds upon itself and steps down just as easily.**"**

## [Feng Suave](https://www.facebook.com/schweyluv/) – Maybe Another Time
Sarah: **"**Dutch group Feng Suave blessed us with a new EP, Warping Youth, in June. This track is my favorite off of that collection. As always with Feng Suave, the mix starts off smooth as silk, and keeps up this mood. The song lives in an easy-going jazz groove while also having some 1960's surfer vibes. The tone reminds me of a anesthetic dream, it doesn't feel real but feels nostalgic and familiar at the same time.**"**

## [Nature TV](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3934926-Snoh-Aalegra) – Hometown
Sarah: **"**A friend sent me this August release by Nature TV, and thank God, because I'm in love with it. Love the 70's influences and the guitar heading the way on this track. Lately, I've been going for drives late at night (for no particular reason) and this has been on my playlist. I think it's a good fit for Sunday mornings, too.**"**

## [TOPS](https://tops.bandcamp.com/) – I Feel Alive
Sarah: **"**The movement on this track is absolutely contagious. Are you feeling alive on this fine Sunday morning? Are you going to dance in your bedroom? Will you have ice cream for breakfast? Will you wear mismatching socks and slide on some hardwood floors? I hope you do all of the above, and you treat yourself to a great Sunday :)**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Thank you so much for listening with us. Thank you to Floam for this sunshine selection, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for this episode's fantastic illustration.</p>
