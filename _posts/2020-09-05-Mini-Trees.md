<p id="introduction">This morning, we are thrilled to welcome [Mini Trees](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) to host the first MailTape episode of September!

Based in Los Angeles, [Mini Trees](https://minitrees.bandcamp.com)

# Mini Trees selection

## [Porches](https://porchesmusic.com/) - Do U Wanna
Mini Trees: **"**Porches has been on repeat for the last few months. Love their last record Ricky Music and this track is one that I keep going back to. It’s dancey and catchy and makes you a little sad; my favorite combo.**"**

## [Lomelda](https://lomelda.bandcamp.com/) - Out There
Mini Trees: **"**I’ve been revisiting this album a lot lately and this is probably my favorite track off of it. Absolutely love Lomelda’s melodies, and lyrically feels very relevant to quarantine.**"** 

## [Ásgeir](https://www.asgeirmusic.com/) - Trust
Mini Trees: **"**This is also not a new song, but I was supposed to see Asgeir in LA with my friend right before quarantine and we ended up backing out because of coronavirus. I'm actually not sure if the concert was canceled or not, but either way I'm sad to have missed out and have been listening to Ásgeir a lot. This is a beautiful song and is a comforting listen amidst all of this.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Floam](https://floam.bandcamp.com/) – Thinking Back
Sarah: **"**The bossa nova groove in the beginning of this track drew me in first, and then throughout the rest of the song, Floam's guitarist does everything right. The mix on *Thinking Back* makes such an interesting balance of rock influences, modern jazz, and experimental production methods. Listen for the break  towards the end of this song, it brings the track to a whole new level. As with all of Floam's discography, Thinking Back is smooth.**"**

## [Schwey](https://www.facebook.com/schweyluv/) – Elasto
Sarah: **"**Coming off of Schwey's 2019 album, funk-infused instrumentals are striking and yet polished into this track. The intensity of the vocals and instrumentals build so naturally, Schwey creates a song you can melt into listening.**"**

## [Snoh Aalegra](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3934926-Snoh-Aalegra) – FEELS
Sarah: **"**Retro energy and Snoh Aalegra's vocals make such a refreshing mix, it's perfect for getting yourself out of bed in the morning.**"**

## [TOPS](https://tops.bandcamp.com/) – I Feel Alive
Sarah: **"**The movement on this track is absolutely contagious. Are you feeling alive on this fine Sunday morning? Are you going to dance in your bedroom? Will you have ice cream for breakfast? Will you wear mismatching socks and slide on some hardwood floors? I hope you do all of the above, and you treat yourself to a great Sunday :)**"**
