<p id="introduction"> This morning, It grows in power little by little or not even at all...We go straight into the rough, we're speed and angry, so by the decision of a certain government, but I'm not going to talk politics here. We are in this state because our guest takes us into our entrenchments, he helps us to deconstruct a music that we had known until now sometimes smooth. He makes us waver between different emotions in these songs. We already knew him in the band The Brums on drums, but today it is through his solo project, Bothlane, that he presents us his playlist this morning.

# Bothlane's selection

## Aldous Harding - Fever
Bothlane: **"**I like Aldous Harding because I like people who have a universe assumed . . when the live is sincere and not a reproduction of what we do in the studio.**"**

## Dorian Concept - Let It All Go
Bothlane: **"**I like the energy and construction of this track and it works well for a Sunday morning :).**"**

##  Alog - Bømlo Brenn Om Natta
Bothlane:**"**Alog remains one of my great discoveries and this slightly crazy piece works too much with excess ginger or caffeine.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Bothlane - Heat
Anaïs G: **"**It is a song that climbs crescendo or rather begins quite quickly in this music called on the edge of the industrial but hypnotizing. As we discover it from a different angle, the drums always its favorite musical object even if the synth is never far away. A nice mix for a perfect energizing and rejuvenating Sunday.**"**
