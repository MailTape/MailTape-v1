<p id="introduction"> This morning, It grows in power little by little or not even at all... We go straight into the rough, we're speed and angry, so by the decision of a certain government, but I'm not going to talk politics here. We are in this state because our guest takes us into our entrenchments, he helps us to deconstruct a music that we had known until now sometimes smooth. He makes us waver between different emotions in these songs. We already knew him in the band The Brums on drums, but today it is through his solo project, Bothlane, that he presents us his playlist this morning.

# Bothlane's selection

## Aldous Harding - Fever
Bothlane: **"**I like Aldous Harding because I like people who have a universe assumed... When the live is sincere and not a reproduction of what we do in the studio.**"**

## Dorian Concept - Let It All Go
Bothlane: **"**I like the energy and construction of this track and it works well for a Sunday morning :).**"**

##  Alog - Bømlo Brenn Om Natta
Bothlane:**"**Alog remains one of my great discoveries and this slightly crazy piece works too much with excess ginger or caffeine.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Bothlane](https://bothlane.bandcamp.com/) - Heat
Anaïs G: **"**It is a song that climbs crescendo or rather begins quite quickly in this music called on the edge of the industrial but hypnotizing. As we discover it from a different angle, the drums always its favorite musical object even if the synth is never far away. A nice mix for a perfect energizing and rejuvenating Sunday.**"**

## Tour-Maubourg  - Just Believe 
Anaïs G: **"**We fully adhere to the Tour-Maubourg style. Through his songs, a perceptible melancholy but also and above all a style mixing house with nu-jazz that adds its touch. Something beautiful, almost poetic emerges from his productions. This track is in the album "[Spaces Of Silence](https://tourmaubourg.bandcamp.com/album/spaces-of-silence)" released on the [Pont Neuf Records](https://pontneuf.bandcamp.com/) label which is a jewel to explore and enjoy.**"**

## Hiatus Kaiyote - Chivalry Is Not Dead
Anaïs G: **"**An incredible discovery with this title from the album "[Mood Vaillant](https://hiatuskaiyote.bandcamp.com/album/mood-valiant)" in 2021, with the bonus of a totally psyched, colorful and offbeat [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9TRMHLyCLo). A nugget to listen to and listen to endlessly. A mix of neo-soul, electro and jazzy-groovy influences.**"**

## [FŒHN](https://foehntrio.bandcamp.com/) -[Same Horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wudC1YzOuY)
Anaïs G: **"**Subtle music, which tells several stories and on the edge of cinematic. It's something perceptible in the songs of this Lyon trio. Strong and soft at the same time, speed and slow at the same time, this jazz-electro is a perfect mix, a surprise to every note made. To be amazed you have to listen to their new album "[Elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADRzDGvjEv0)" released last January.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning's selection! Thank you for joining us :) Our love to [Bothlane](https://bothlane.bandcamp.com/) for these wonderful Sunday selections, and many many thanks to the guest illustration by Lucie Fléty for this episode's fantastic artwork!</p>
