<p id="introduction">As winter is definitely anchored, there is nothing like staying in bed, enjoying a warm coffee with a delicious breakfast, listening some very comforting tracks, like candies for the ears... And that's what we carefully crafted for you today with [Juniore](https://heyjuniore.bandcamp.com), a french indie-pop band. Instrumental tracks, smooth vibrations like a warm sonic blankets: this morning selection begins with some soothing classical records picked by Juniore, just to help you arise from Morphee's kingdom. The whole thing with a bit of french accent and inspirations from the recklessness sounds from the 60's...

# Ghosts, towns, and girls tales...

[Juniore](https://heyjuniore.bandcamp.com) is an all-female band led by the parisian Anna Jean. With their surf-pop deeply anchored in the sixties, Juniore's music is made of reverbed guitars coupled to vocal harmonies full of spleen and rythms, inspired by a world of ghosts, towns, cars and girls tales...


# Juniore's selection

+ ## Santo et Johnny - Sleepwalk
_Juniore_: **"**For the lazy mornings, the tougher or the fuzzy ones. For the sunday morning that follow a restless Saturday, a great deal guitars made of cotton, creamy melodies, this track is like a syrup that gets your head (and organs) straight. As the mysterious Mary Poppins says: "A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down". Efficiency guarantees.**"**

+ ## Margo Guryan - Sunday Morning
_Juniore_: **"**For the mornings under a grey sky, full of cotton (and getting back to bed...)**"**

+ ## Erik Satie - Gymnopédie N°1
_Juniore_: **"**For the morose and nostalgic mornings. Or simply the mornings full of serenity (yes, it must also happen, Satie's Gnossienne or Gymnopédie is the best solution for a moment full of contemplation, a waking dream.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Juniore - Panique
_Olivier_: **"**With this track, Juniore transform their surf-pop into an addictive and stressfull pop. As we enter this new year, the world around is becoming more and more worrisome and Anna Jean use this song to express her feelings about it. She makes a kind of mockery of it by telling an inconsequent story of a panic in love. With catchy lyrics, vigorous and stressfull lines of guitars and organs supported by a restless drum, the whole thing put torgether into a hectic mix, Panique is like a steamroller that will boost your day!**"**

+ ## GYM - Your Woman (White Town cover)
_Olivier_: **"**I've picked this track mostly because of this haunted bell melody that is the perfect answer to Juniore's Panique atmosphere. Then, the bouncing bass line makes us noding our head unconsciously and GYM singer's indolent voice lead us to a realy good mood! And I thought the lyrics "I could never be your woman" introduce very well the next track of this selection...**"**

+ ## Jo Wedin & Jean Felzine - Idiot
_Olivier_: **"**Nothing better than this song to pay tribute to the sounds of the sixties and to the iconic love duo that were recorded at that time. As Juniore kept the "darker" sides of those years, full of cowboy boots and two-time motors, this song reflects the touching innocence of this era. Both singers act beautifuly their role in this drama. It's perfect to start the day with fresh and enthusiastic ideas.**"**

+ ## Lemon Swell - Track
_Olivier_: **"**For the final track of this episode, I wanted to answer to the first track "Sleepwalk" with an instrumental piece, made of aerial and psychedelic guitars. Some kind of a outro that close this episode in a very cinematic way...**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks to [Juniore](https://heyjuniore.bandcamp.com) for their selection and have a nice day! </p>
