<p id="introduction">Our guest of the week, [Dear Pola](https://dearpola.bandcamp.com/)'s voice is a subtle gush of ambient, indie and alternative sounds resting peacefully within her. </p>

# A voice to treasure

There’s a moment that’s holdless; a voice that resonates deep within someone’s heart; a stillness that prevails and yet stings like wind on a cold wintry night. In that moment, a muse absorbed in clear thought croons, often at times, like a bird singing distantly from a branch while those who willfully listen, are not only pacified but entranced. 
 
# Dear Pola's selection:

## Stranded Horse - Monde

Dear Pola: **"**I'm a big fan of Stranded Horse, since the beginning of his carreer. I really like musical weddings, crossbreeding and mixed influences. Stranded Horse do it in the best way...**"**

## Farao - Bodies

Dear Pola: **"**I love haunting patterns, cyclical rhythms, paradoxes. It moves me easily! The coexistence of sweet and stirring...**"**

## Ed Tullett - Malignant

Dear Pola: **"**He walks on the tightrope, at the border of folk and electronic music. There are marked cadences and a lot of disenchantment. Everything I love! Let's say it suits my sunday morning's mood!**"**
