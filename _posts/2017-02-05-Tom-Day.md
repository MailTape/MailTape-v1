<p id="introduction">Today, we have the pleasure to welcome the Australian producer [Tom Day](http://music.tomday.me) for a sweet selection of tracks. Based in Melbourne, Tom has been creating ambient and electronic music since 2005. Inspired by seasons, ocean beaches and natural openness of large Australian landscapes, his work is made of piano melodies, elegant beats and an array of personnaly-collected field recordings.</p>

<p>This morning, his selection of tracks is full of poetry, emotions and sonic landscapes. So relax, feel the wide spaces offered by the selection and enjoy a regenerating meditative break, cleaning up the stress of the past week.</p>


# **Tom Day’s selection**

+ ## Luke Howard - Port
_Tom Day_: **"**I discovered Luke after the release of his "Sun, Cloud" album. He is an all-time favourite pianist of mine and one of Melbourne's best exports. His music regularly finds a place in my relaxed Sunday playlist.**"**

+ ## Grey Reverend - My Hands
_Tom Day_: **"**I was lucky enough to catch a Cinematic Orchestra concert while they were here in Oz. Grey Reverend featured on a live rendition of "To Build A Home" and within an hour of finishing the concert, I had purchased his album. The whole album is amazing but this track is a particular favourite of mine.**"**

+ ## Eluvium - Regenerative Being
_Tom Day_: **"**Eluvium is a relatively new discovery for me. I really love his use of textures and layering in this album. The aria/opera sampling is the icing on the cake and works really well with the progression of the song. Love it!"**"**
