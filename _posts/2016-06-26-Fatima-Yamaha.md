As he did on the latest WeLoveGreen festival, [Fatima Yamaha](https://www.facebook.com/FatimaYamaha/) brings rays of sun with his energetic and trippy selection.

# Music & Humanity

Repetition, repetition. Harmony, melody, feeling. Roar, shout, cry. Articulate, sing, rap. Isn't it amazing how a simple difference of pressure in the air which produces a wave of vibration ends in our ear, get interpreted by a neural network of infinite complexity and translates into emotions?

Emotion gives birth to inspiration which produces ideas. Projected on the screen of closed eyelids, light and images strobes. Billions of electric impulsions send information inside the brain, translating it into pulsation and ultimately into movement.

Take the most intense city you know, multiply it by 1000 and we're still far from the boiling excitation of billions of cells forming the human body. Then comes the power of imagination when a shout becomes a word and a movement a dance.

What if what we call today 'music' was at the origin of humanity? What if music was so much deeply linked to our basic needs that our survival on this planet depended on it? 

# Fatima Yamaha's selection:

## Belmer - Bioroid
_Fatima Yamaha_:**"**Bioroids are genetically engineered humans that are superior in overall biology, but feature intentionally suppressed emotional capabilities. I think I run in to them on a daily basis.**"**
