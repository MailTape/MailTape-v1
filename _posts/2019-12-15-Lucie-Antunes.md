# Lucie Antunes' selection

## Ligeti - Lux Aeterna
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I don't know how to listen to music other than concentrated. On Sunday mornings, if I have my coffee to music, I am 100% involved in what is happening. This song requires that kind of concentration. If it is very early, watch the sunrise at the same time. Otherwise, just close your eyes and let yourself be carried away by this 16-part A capella canon. The impression of being in balance on a thread, on the verge of always falling but never actually falling. Ligeti wrote: « On the still surface of the water, we see an image reflected, then the water wrinkles, the image deteriorates and disappears; very gradually, while the surface of the water stops, a new, different image then appears. »**"**

## [Ryan Power](https://ryanpower.bandcamp.com/album/i-don-t-want-to-die) - I don’t want to die
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I discovered this song during [Moodoïd](https://www.mailta.pe/325/moodoid/)'s tour, it was Pablo who put it in the van and I thought it was wonderful. Simple and at the same time complex. Sweet but nostalgic. No manners or fuss. A good start to the day after Ligeti's cosmological awakening.**"**

## [Sufjan Steven](https://music.sufjan.com/) - The tallest man, the broadest shoulders part I and II
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I love this artist, the Illinois album is a marvel. Beautifully well written, this track particularly puts me in a very good mood. Whatever happens to you this Sunday, with this song, you can only be happy.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Fun Fun Funeral](https://funfunfuneral.bandcamp.com/) – Elba Sea
_ImaCrea_: **"**It is unlike any other, it is tinged with a joyfulpop, it all ows you to escape your mind for a few moments and enter the magical world of this franco-english duo. It's an eccentric brass band that allows us to escape and take the life on the right side!**"**

## Eera – Christine
_ImaCrea_: **"**Through her music, [Eera](https://www.facebook.com/eeramusic/) teaches us to face our fears and to face them. It is with her sweet voice that the Norwegian Anna Lena Bruland aka Eera, reveals her weaknesses and counts her doubts to us, to better advance and face life but also to recover the lost confidence.**"**

## Promise Keeper – Backfired
_ImaCrea_:**"**Discovered in 2017 with [the label Atelier Ciseaux](http://www.atelierciseaux.com/category/news/), it is one of the songs that do not ageand above all that i can listen to over and over again without moderation. William Fussel aka [Promise Keeper](https://atelierciseaux.bandcamp.com/album/promise-keeper-s-t), manages to immerse us in an extreme trance and a feeling of ultimate weel-being comparable to he enjoyment of the body. It's beautiful it's hot.. I don't have the words !**"**

## Samana – Harvest
_ImaCrea_: **"**Soft, sumptuous and hypnotic, these are the adjectives that come to mind when i listen to [Samana](https://www.samanaroad.com/samana-home). This feminine/male duo formed by Rebecca Rose Harris and Franklin Mockett plays with colors, black and white, and note of music architecture throught their first album "[Ascension](https://samana.bandcamp.com/album/ascension)", released last May. Perfect for sunday morning full of hope.**"**
