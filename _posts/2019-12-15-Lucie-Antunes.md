# Lucie Antunes' selection

## Ligeti - Lux Aeterna
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I don't know how to listen to music other than concentrated. On Sunday mornings, if I have my coffee to music, I am 100% involved in what is happening. This song requires that kind of concentration. If it is very early, watch the sunrise at the same time. Otherwise, just close your eyes and let yourself be carried away by this 16-part A capella canon. The impression of being in balance on a thread, on the verge of always falling but never actually falling. Ligeti wrote: « On the still surface of the water, we see an image reflected, then the water wrinkles, the image deteriorates and disappears; very gradually, while the surface of the water stops, a new, different image then appears. »**"**

## [Ryan Power](https://ryanpower.bandcamp.com/album/i-don-t-want-to-die) - I don’t want to die
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I discovered this song during [Moodoïd](https://www.mailta.pe/325/moodoid/)'s tour, it was Pablo who put it in the van and I thought it was wonderful. Simple and at the same time complex. Sweet but nostalgic. No manners or fuss. A good start to the day after Ligeti's cosmological awakening.**"**

## [Sufjan Steven](https://music.sufjan.com/) - The tallest man, the broadest shoulders part I and II
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I love this artist, the Illinois album is a marvel. Beautifully well written, this track particularly puts me in a very good mood. Whatever happens to you this Sunday, with this song, you can only be happy.**"**
