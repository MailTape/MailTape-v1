<p id="introduction">Certainty is ephemeral. Noise. Make noise. In peace or with force. Convictions and needs, solutions and seeds? What must we shed, what must we feed?</p>

<p>
Music never exits my bubble. It always remains. Creating a pace, accelerating, slowing, taming and often rewiring.

Today’s MailTape is an ode to the current times. A pinch in the center of the palm reminding us, awaking us to the very truth we are all faced with. As the walls of illusions fall dry, as the lights dim and the candles are lit, life perceived, just as a glass bottle exploding onto marble, is shattering slowly into a mist of dusty hail. As the streets are shaking and the voices are rising, we are left with the dark matter of truth; how to carry on living life in a place where life seems to disappear? Where are the cradles of love and the bells of hopes? Where are the new streets and safety lights? Exhausted from our neck-bending routines, hiding from the shameful existence we all wished to dissipate.

This selection hums the voices of today. Comfort aside, just as we must stop listening to the common speech, it is time to expand our ears, clear our vision, navigate new realms and elevate from our habitual minds. A powerful and touching selection of tracks to ghost ourselves from the poison of illusions and hatred as we enter into a realm of hope wondering, as Sandra Nkaké says so well; what does it mean to be born?

# Lucie Antunes' selection

## Ligeti - Lux Aeterna
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I don't know how to listen to music other than concentrated. On Sunday mornings, if I have my coffee to music, I am 100% involved in what is happening. This song requires that kind of concentration. If it is very early, watch the sunrise at the same time. Otherwise, just close your eyes and let yourself be carried away by this 16-part A capella canon. The impression of being in balance on a thread, on the verge of always falling but never actually falling. Ligeti wrote: « On the still surface of the water, we see an image reflected, then the water wrinkles, the image deteriorates and disappears; very gradually, while the surface of the water stops, a new, different image then appears. »**"**

## [Ryan Power](https://ryanpower.bandcamp.com/album/i-don-t-want-to-die) - I don’t want to die
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I discovered this song during [Moodoïd](https://www.mailta.pe/325/moodoid/)'s tour, it was Pablo who put it in the van and I thought it was wonderful. Simple and at the same time complex. Sweet but nostalgic. No manners or fuss. A good start to the day after Ligeti's cosmological awakening.**"**

## [Sufjan Steven](https://music.sufjan.com/) - The tallest man, the broadest shoulders part I and II
_Lucie Antunes_: **"**I love this artist, the Illinois album is a marvel. Beautifully well written, this track particularly puts me in a very good mood. Whatever happens to you this Sunday, with this song, you can only be happy.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Lucie Antunes](https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/serge) - Blue Child
_ImaCrea_: **"**If Philip Glass and Caribou had a child, would he/she be blue? There's something in this track that's so daring in a way, this subtle way of achieving balance between contemporary music and pop music. It requires generosity and hard work to be able to build such a bridge between these two worlds and it's exactly what I find Lucie Antunes is achieving in her [latest album](https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/serge). If you enjoy the occasion to go to her show, don't hesitate a second. It's been one of the best concerts I've had the chance to see/listen this year.**"**

## [Sentimental Rave](https://sentimentalrave.bandcamp.com/) - Never Asking Favours
_ImaCrea_: **"**We want beauty and lightness. But our world is at stake, it's no mystery. And this track serve as a reminder, it's echoing so many internal fights we are collectively enduring. It's raw, not cooked, all the music nutrient are within there. Absorb, dance and let the joy shine. This clear cut in this selection is in addition to prompt you that MailTape is undriven by a senseless "artificial intelligence". Not a single one would have selected such a track because it's not "comfortable", it's a risk that big companies like Spotify, Deezer and else can't afford. We can, because we are fully independent thanks to your donations and without freedom, human soul dies slowly.**"**

## [Sunni Colón](https://soundcloud.com/sunnicolon/) - Strands of the Future
_ImaCrea_:**"**At this time we unloaded all the fear with Sentimental Rave's cathartic sound, this track by Sunni Colón is absolutely perfect to get into a state of flow. This guitar, these violins, gosh it gives me chills.**"**

## [Sandra Nkaké](https://sandrankake.blogspot.com/) - River
_ImaCrea_: **"**Sandra Nkaké is back with a stunning album. Her voice plus the beauty of her lyrics and this birdish flute flying all around encapsulates well the global idea of this tape I feel. Well the global idea of MailTape : celebration of love and music. Bless you PS2KY for suggesting me to add this track :).**"**


<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us this Sunday. Much love to [Lucie Antunes](https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/serge) for her inspiring Sunday selections, [Thibaut Daumin](https://thibaultdaumain.fr/) for his amazing illustration and PS2KY for her poetry.</p>
