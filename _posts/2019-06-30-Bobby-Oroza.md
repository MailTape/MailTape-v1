<p id="introduction"> This morning, 
<br><br>

[Bobby Oroza](https://bobbyoroza.bandcamp.com/) is 
</p>


# Bobby's selection



## Chico Buarque - Ole, Olá
[Bobby Oroza](https://bobbyoroza.bandcamp.com/): **"**Chico Buarque was often playing in my childhood home. My little sister would sing this song beautifully. It’s equally sad and happy, devastated but ready for the next dance.**"**

## Gloria Ann Taylor - World That’s Not Real
[Bobby Oroza](https://bobbyoroza.bandcamp.com/): **"**It’s her voice, her piercing soulfulness. The orchestration supports her artistry. It reminds me of La Planete Sauvage somehow. It’s a heavy peace that cathartically purifies your Sunday energies.**"**

## Johnnie Frierson - Have You Been Good to Yourself
[Bobby Oroza](https://bobbyoroza.bandcamp.com/): **"**What ever your system, I’ve personally found that Sunday’s a good day for a sermon, a little preaching maybe and checkin in to your spiritual affairs. This song is straight at ya style. No cryptic bullshit here.**"**
