<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Dublin-based musician, [Ruba Shamshoum](http://ruba.land/), who collaborates with us to provide a beautifully laid-back Sunday morning playlist.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Palestine, Ruba released her debut album ‘Shamat’ (Beauty Spots) last year. The musicality of the Arabic language—and subtle shifts of weight in her own phrasing— percolate throughout the compositions that are supported by Aleka Potinga's cello, Matthew Jacobson's percussion, Orlando Molina's guitar and Barry Rycraft's double bass.</p>


# Ruba Shamshoum's selection


## Ella Fitzgerald – Blue Skies
_Ruba Shamshoum_: **"**Ella's voice was my first introduction to female jazz singers. The motherly warmth in her voice, playfulness in her scat language, and ability to transition from a silky-smooth voice of a woman in love, to a child-like naughty little girl always inspired me to explore new sounds in my own voice. When she sings, it sounds like she's giving you an affectionate warm hug, and assuring you that it'll all be just fine. I love "Blue Skies", especially because of the great solo that shows the spectrum of her incredible voice. Any song by her would be good for a Sunday morning, afternoon or evening. **"**

## Esperanza Spalding – Little Fly
_Ruba Shamshoum_: **"**I love Esperanza so much! I always look forward to hearing new material from her. I love that she approaches music from both a scholar's point of view, and a child playing with endless creativity. She reinvents herself in every new album, and always manages to sound super fresh. This song is from her 'Chamber Music Society' album, and I love it so much because it sounds like an intimate conversation between her and the bass, with the strings filling the space with colours.**"**

## Fairouz – يا زنبق يا غاوي
_Ruba Shamshoum_: **"**If you ask people in the Middle East of their choice of morning music, they would most probably say Fairouz. She is the Goddess of the morning, her nostalgic voice and Al Rahbani brothers' melodies give so much hope for new beginnings. This is one of my favourite songs by her.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Ruba Shamshoum – (In the Depth) في الاعماق
_Sanjay_: **"**Recorded in the Church of Notre-Dame de la Dalbade in Toulouse, [Saåad](http://www.saaadrone.com/) make exceptional use of massive Puget pipe organs originating from 1888. But Romain and Gregory don't limit themselves to the organs. They've managed to use the entire church with its incredible Renaissance acoustics as a tool to craft a sense of overpowering ambience throughout 'Verdaillon', the album from which this track is taken.**"**

## Cécile McLorin Salvant – Le Front Cache Sur Tes Genoux
_Sanjay_: **"**[Julianna Barwick](http://www.juliannabarwick.com/) flips this instrumental into a stripped-down dream. Though her voice is barely present here. It is only detectable as a very distant peal flitting around the edges of tumbling pianos, before she introduces a pulsing kick drum and lurching sub-bass.**"**

## Jazzmeia Horn – So Easy to Love
_Sanjay_: **"**This piece was recorded in a disused cistern 14 feet beneath the earth in Washington State by [Pauline Oliveros](http://www.paulineoliveros.us/), who sadly passed away on 24th November 2016. She developed the idea of listening as ritual, healing, and meditation that also led to her founding the Deep Listening Institute. She discovered the Deep Listening phenomenon in that cistern in Fort Worden in 1989, with its reverberation time of 45 seconds, alongside trombonist Stuart Dempster and sound artist Panaiotis, who are her co-collaborators on this album.**"**

## Zara McFarlane – Chiaroscuro
_Sanjay_: **"**Evoking memories of pirate radio, Bristol-based musician [Sophia Loizou](http://www.sophialoizou.com/) creates a ghostly atmosphere with remnants of hardcore and early jungle percolating throughout. Fragments of radio transmissions seep in and out through tape-based processes and spectral processing, like a craggy landscape falling into disintegration.**"**
