<p id="introduction">This morning, get ready for a vibrant sunday with Deluxe. Open your eyes and let the beauty come in your house. The atmosphere is getting warmer. Stretch your body, make your biggest smile and dance with the sun.</p>

# Deluxe, crazy frenchies !

Discovered during the latest "Solidays" festival, their live performance was among the most exhilarating. Jumping, shouting, dancing, they hypnotised the crowd with their viral energy. Not so surprising after all when you know Deluxe is part of Chinese Man Records. They definitely got the groove and if they stop at your city, it's a must-go for sure. Unfortunately I find it difficult to feel all that legendary energy in their records and I hope they'll manage to mix it in a better way on a next album.

# Their energetic selection.

+ ## Curtis Mayfield - Little Child Running Wild
_Deluxe_: **"**Curtis Mayfield is the base... and this track is a "brûlure" as we're used to say ! Vintage keyboards, loving brass intruments, supreme guitar and a mesmerizing voice which remind us our first musical crushes! Although our music inspirations may differ, this kind of soul/funk songs are the ones that gather us and are the basics of what we're trying to create. Curtis deserves a beautiful moustache !**"**

+ ## The Roots - The Seed
_Deluxe_: **"**Here again, these hip-hop vibes are the "roots" of our sound ! Mix the Roots, a thrilling bass/drums ensemble and Black Thought flow and you're sure to add a new dimension to this Coddy Chestnut classic track ! The video, apparently simple on a first look, where you can see The Roots playing with Coddy Chestnut in their house, truly welcomes you to join them and dance around ! **"**

+ ## Fat Boy Slim - Praise You
_Deluxe_: **"**The end of 2000's... and the beginning of today's sound ! A lil piano, dirty effects, "phat" bass and repetitive durms... a complete era summed up in a track ! Again, its surprising video directed by Spike Jonze complete the whole picture. We listen to this in the morning when shaving our beard, whether we feel sad or happy... but most of the time we listen to it when chilling on a sofa !**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks, thanks to Deluxe and I hope you'll find inspiration by listening to this episode. Love.</p>
