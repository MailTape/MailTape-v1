<p id="introduction"> We are overjoyed to welcome r mccarthy to MailTape this sleepy Sunday morning :) As a gift to our waking up, his selection embraces new worlds of new age music, stretching time and sound into spaces unknown, carving creativity out of these early morning hours.  
  <br><br>
r mccarthy, or Rory, joins us on MailTape for the second time since 2017, when we welcomed his other label, [infinite bisous](https://www.mailta.pe/245/infinite-bisous/). </p>

# r mccarthy's selection

## [Operating Theatre](https://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/) - Elation After Hours
r mccarthy: **"**Irish musician Roger Doyle had this musical theatre project (Operating Theatre), I don’t really understand the context it would have appeared in, but I love the music. He was apparently the first musician in Ireland to get his hands on a Fairlight CMI, one of my favourite instruments. The whole album (Miss Mauger) is very surprising and beautiful..**"**

## [Yoshihiro Hanno](http://www.yoshihirohanno.com/discography/) and [Mick Karn](https://mickkarn.net/) - Lunette
r mccarthy: **"**This is taken from one of my favourite albums, ‘Liquid Glass’. Mick Karn sometimes has no respect for the key of a song, and it doesn’t make a difference because what he’s playing sounds great. I think he just plays things which feel funny under his fingers, I respect that and it sounds amazing.**"**

## [John Powell](https://johnpowellmusic.com/) - Chicken In The Pot
r mccarthy: **"**I was watching one of the Star Wars shows (’Solo’ apparently), which was ok. But then there was this scene in a bar, obviously the original ‘Cantina Band’ was amazing, so I thought ‘Hmm I wonder what they’ll do for the music here’, and then this song started and it’s one of the strangest feeling pieces of music I’ve heard in a while. Once again the bass player has no respect for the key, it’s in an alien language, the strings are pretty amazing, I like it.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [r mccarthy](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - I Think I Lost That Love
Sarah: **"**r mccarthy's weaving synth work throughout this track lands so effortlessly, the sparse percussives and hovering synth harmonies slide alongside each other with so much grace -- engulfing us in blanketed textures against this buildup of soft vocals. The rest of this 2017 release continues this balanced freshness in production, I have a special soft spot for Jyoti :).**"**

## [Omni Gardens](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/) - Algae After All
Sarah: **"**This track brings us to another world, brimming with the filminess of green underwater flora below some distant speckled reflective surface. I used this track in my play for its brainscape and aquascaping scenes, the harmonies here transport you to the swaying micro worlds of green and growth. (r mccarthy's Jyoti opened up the play's brainscape space). The synth work's exploratory melody along with the droning hums of these undertones feel healing in some sense, like you're growing roots and new leaves just by listening to it -- living a newfound peaceful life as a spatch of algae :)**"**

## [Paul Lansky](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1126272-Sachiko-Kanenobu) - Her Voice
Sarah: **"**On our last class of the semester, my music professor introduced us to Paul Lansky's [exploratory](http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/liner_notes/fantasies.html) 1994 album, [Fantasies and Tableaux](https://www.newworldrecords.org/products/paul-lansky-fantasies-and-tableaux). This is the first track off the release, and after listening through the rest of the collection, it's still my favorite ([Her Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lppSwmBBmOk) is a close second). The production process here is interesting, Paul Lansky uses his wife's voice as a technical instrument for the entire piece (bassline, chords, etc.), producing some of the synthwork with linear predictive coding. I love the haunting quality of his resulting product, approaching the uncanny valley of voice but still with the romantic context to make me smile.**"**

## [Elori Saxl](https://morsels.website/) - Moss II
Sarah: **"**This track arrives from Touchtheplants' 2021 album [Sound Wonders: A Series of Epics](https://www.touchtheplants.com/products/sound-wonders-lp), a compilation that includes several other wonderful artists including harpist [Nailah Hunter](https://nailahhunter.bandcamp.com/) and [SK Kakraba](https://skkakraba.bandcamp.com/). The fleeting power and playfulness of the sax here sounds like my favorite recurring dream, where the moss reclaims me. (Patches of carpet moss, strictly speaking... there's a film of mist all around and overhead, hosting a peaceful and insulated string of moments -- the moss has little green hands that embrace my arms as if it's been ages, and all that can be seen are these green stretches of softness welcoming me back.) The image might be from reading too much Seamus Heaney, especially the last stanza of [this poem](https://irelandtour.sunygeneseoenglish.org/resources/poems/heaneys-the-strand-at-lough-beg/) and [this one](https://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/poems/heaney/personal_helicon.php). Elori Saxl's description of this epic in the album's release details a similar binding to the moss, where she explains how she felt, sitting on a bed of moss in a shaded forrest, "the world was pulsing all around me and I never wanted it to end" but she also was "very aware that it was already slipping away."**"**
