<p id="introduction"> We are overjoyed to welcome r mccarthy to MailTape this sleepy Sunday morning :) As a gift to our waking up, his selection embraces new worlds of new age music, stretching time and sound into spaces unknown, carving creativity out of these early morning hours.  
  <br><br>
r mccarthy, or Rory, joins us on MailTape for the second time since 2017, when we welcomed his other label, [infinite bisous](https://www.mailta.pe/245/infinite-bisous/). </p>

# r mccarthy's selection

## [Operating Theatre](https://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/) - Elation After Hours
r mccarthy: **"**Irish musician Roger Doyle had this musical theatre project (Operating Theatre), I don’t really understand the context it would have appeared in, but I love the music. He was apparently the first musician in Ireland to get his hands on a Fairlight CMI, one of my favourite instruments. The whole album (Miss Mauger) is very surprising and beautiful..**"**

## [Yoshihiro Hanno](http://www.yoshihirohanno.com/discography/) and [Mick Karn](https://mickkarn.net/) - Lunette
r mccarthy: **"**This is taken from one of my favourite albums, ‘Liquid Glass’. Mick Karn sometimes has no respect for the key of a song, and it doesn’t make a difference because what he’s playing sounds great. I think he just plays things which feel funny under his fingers, I respect that and it sounds amazing.**"**

## [John Powell](https://johnpowellmusic.com/) - Chicken In The Pot
r mccarthy: **"**I was watching one of the Star Wars shows (’Solo’ apparently), which was ok. But then there was this scene in a bar, obviously the original ‘Cantina Band’ was amazing, so I thought ‘Hmm I wonder what they’ll do for the music here’, and then this song started and it’s one of the strangest feeling pieces of music I’ve heard in a while. Once again the bass player has no respect for the key, it’s in an alien language, the strings are pretty amazing, I like it.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [r mccarthy](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - I Think I Lost That Love
Sarah: **"**r mccarthy's synth work throughout this track is so effortlessly fresh, the sparse percussives and hovering synth harmonies slide alongside each other with so much grace -- engulfing us in texture with this buildup of soft vocals. The rest of this 2017 release is interesting as well, I have a soft spot for Jyoti :).**"**

## [Omni Gardens](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/) - Algae After All
Sarah: **"**This track takes us to another world, brimming with the green film of underwater flora reaching up to the surface. I used this track in my play for the brainscape and aquascaping scenes, it transports you to these micro worlds of green and growth. (r mccarthy's Jyoti opened up the play's brainscape space). The synth work's exploratory melody along with the droning overtones feel healing in some sense, like you're growing roots and new leaves listening to it -- living a newfound peaceful life as a spatch of algae. Imagine!**"**

## [Paul Lansky](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1126272-Sachiko-Kanenobu) - Her Voice
Sarah: **"**On our last class of the semester, my music professor introduced us to Paul Lansky's 1982 album, Fantasies and Tableaux. This is the first track off the release, and after listening through the rest of the collection, it's still my favorite (Her Song is a close second). The production process here is super interesting, Paul Lansky uses his wife's voice as a technical instrument for the entire piece (bassline, chords, etc.) and produces some of this synthwork with linear predictive coding. I love the haunting quality of the resulting product, approaching the uncanny valley of voice but still with the romantic context to make me smile.**"**

## [Elori Saxl](https://morsels.website/) - Moss II
Sarah: **"**Oh, I just love this one. This track arrives from the 2021 album Sound Wonders: A Series of Epics, a compilation which includes several other wonderful artists including harpist Nailah Hunter and SK Kakraba.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up today's morning selection! Thank you for joining us. Our love to r mccarthy for his delightful Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's fantastic illustration! Merry merry merry :)</p>
