<p id="introduction"> As our gift to you this morning, we welcome r mccarthy to MailTape :)
  <br><br>
[INO hidefumi](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/)'s style stretches from electronic to jazz to ambient music, melding aspects of all these genres in the process. INO joins us following the release of his dark and mellow jazz-electro album, [In Dreams](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/album/in-dreams). This album, like all those before it, was released through his label [Innocent Records](https://innocentrecord.stores.jp/), a pioneer of the **one artist-one label** movement. Through this release and the ones of the past years, INO urges us "Don't Listen, Feel!" embracing a love of music that transcends technicalities or pretension. It's with this attitude that he joins us this morning :)

# r mccarthy's selection

## [Operating Theatre](https://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/) - Elation After Hours
r mccarthy: **"**Irish musician Roger Doyle had this musical theatre project (Operating Theatre), I don’t really understand the context it would have appeared in, but I love the music. He was apparently the first musician in Ireland to get his hands on a Fairlight CMI, one of my favourite instruments. The whole album (Miss Mauger) is very surprising and beautiful..**"**

## [Yoshihiro Hanno](http://www.yoshihirohanno.com/discography/) and [Mick Karn](https://mickkarn.net/) - Lunette
r mccarthy: **"**This is taken from one of my favourite albums, ‘Liquid Glass’. Mick Karn sometimes has no respect for the key of a song, and it doesn’t make a difference because what he’s playing sounds great. I think he just plays things which feel funny under his fingers, I respect that and it sounds amazing.**"**

## [John Powell](https://johnpowellmusic.com/) - Chicken In The Pot
r mccarthy: **"**I was watching one of the Star Wars shows (’Solo’ apparently), which was ok. But then there was this scene in a bar, obviously the original ‘Cantina Band’ was amazing, so I thought ‘Hmm I wonder what they’ll do for the music here’, and then this song started and it’s one of the strangest feeling pieces of music I’ve heard in a while. Once again the bass player has no respect for the key, it’s in an alien language, the strings are pretty amazing, I like it.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [r mccarthy](https://inohidefumi.bandcamp.com/) - I Think I Lost That Love
Sarah: **"**Love r mccarthy's synth work throughout this track, the sparse percussives and droning synths work so well together. The rest of this release is interesting as well, love the buildup with vocals.**"**

## [Omni Gardens](https://hairdo.bandcamp.com/) - Algae After All
Sarah: **"**This was one of the tracks I used in my play for the brainscape / aquascaping scene. (I also used r mccarthy's Jyoti to open up the brainscape).**"**

## [Paul Lansky](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1126272-Sachiko-Kanenobu) - Her Voice
Sarah: **"**My music professor introduced us to Paul Lansky's 1982 album, Fantasies and Tableaux on our last class. This is the first track off the release, but after listening through the rest of the collection, I think it's still my favorite (Her Song is a close second). The production process here is super interesting, Paul Lansky uses his wife's voice as a technical instrument for the entire piece (bassline, chords, etc.) and produces it with linear predictive coding -- very cutting edge in the 70's when he was writing this.**"**

## [Elori Saxl](https://morsels.website/) - Moss II
Sarah: **"**This track arrives from the 2021 album Sound Wonders: A Series of Epics, a compilation which includes several other wonderful artists including harpist Nailah Hunter and SK Kakraba.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That wraps up this morning's selection! As always, thank you for joining us. Our love to INO hidefumi for his delightful Sunday discoveries, and our thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/illustration) for this episode's fantastic illustration!</p>
