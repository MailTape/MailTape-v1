  This morning, we send each other love, we hug each other through our masks, we
  send each other kisses through our windows. You try to forget the dull days,
  the sad news and concentrate on memories of holidays, of moments spent
  surrounded by friends or family. To accompany us in this quest for the inner
  sun, we have the voice of Schérazade.

<p id="introduction">This morning, we send each other love, we hug each other through our masks, we send each other kisses through our windows. You try to forget the dull days, the sad news and concentrate on memories of holidays, of moments spent surrounded by friends or family. To accompany us in this quest for the inner sun, we have the voice of [Schérazade](https://www.facebook.com/scherazadeofficiel).
<br><br>
It is through flushes of love that we find [Schérazade](https://www.instagram.com/scherazade_officiel/). A sincere, committed, sensual and fun music.. The best cocktail to make for a successful Sunday morning!
</p>


# Schérazade's selection

## [Nick Hakim](https://nickhakim.com/) - Let it out 
Schérazade: **"**To wake up Nicely i listen this wonderful interlude but actually this is also my sunday album for sure.I love this artist that i discover recently, the flow the instrumental, this strange psyché feeling i mean i love everything. I really love my sunday vibe on Nick.**"**

## [LA Priest](https://www.facebook.com/trulylapriest) - What Moves
Schérazade: **"**What a better day than Sunday to listen the new album of La Priest (Gene) I saw him on live in Paris he was alone with his instruments it was my best show ever for sure. I really like his music , it's very experimental a particular pop, and he's one of the best guitar player for me.**"**

## [Flash and The Pan](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_and_the_Pan) - Waiting for the sun
Schérazade: **"**This music help me do some homework, i do listen this track since i was teenager i really like to dance on it also. So Let's dance!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Schérazade](https://www.instagram.com/scherazade_officiel/) - Philanthrope
Anaïs G: **"**It was while listening to "[Pink Flamingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwlGzDQPDHU)" that I discovered Scherazade. Her voice seduced me, mixing such strength and incredible sensitivity, that one remains speechless in the face of this talent. A multifaceted artist, who released an album in February this year, "Asile Exquis". An EP that we would listen to a bit like an open book, perfect for this second confinement.**"**

## [Genevieve Artadi](https://www.facebook.com/genevieveartadi) - Hot Mess
Anaïs G: **"**[Hot Mess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7PdFDhKvE) is a bit like a crush. It’s soft, light, sensual... Genevieve mixes styles: a little destructured and electronic sometimes with a r’n’b and jazzy side assumed. With her speechless voice she will take us into an imaginary where it is good to live!**"**

## [The Marias](https://www.themarias.us/) - I Don't Know You
Anaïs G: **"**When you listen to their music, you want to stop time. To curl up in the sheets with our lover and enjoy a sexy vibe to indulge in the pleasure of the flesh...Their soul psychedelic, wraps us in tissue paper, an exquisite sensation, full of surprise and charm.**"**

## [Space Captain](https://spacecaptainofficial.bandcamp.com/album/secret-garden-back-of-my-mind) - Secret Garden
Anaïs G: **"**Slow down the pace, take time, get back to basics. The Space Captain song is an ode to slow life, so let's do the same on this Sunday morning.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us. Much love to [Schérazade](https://www.facebook.com/scherazadeofficiel) for her Sunday selections and to [Thibault Daumain](http://thibaultdaumain.fr/) for this episode's brilliant illustration. </p>
