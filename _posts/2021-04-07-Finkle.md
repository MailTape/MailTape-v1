Joji - Your Man / Vincent

I like to listen to this song because it makes me happy. Every Sunday morning I put this song and even if I’m sad or a little melancholic it transmits me some good vibe and I feel better. Joji is this kind of artist who puts some soul into a track and I really like it.

Benjamin Diamond - Fit Your Heart / Jean Heude

Take a coffee, dance to the track and see what’s happening.

Half Moon Run - 21 Gun Salute / Maxime

There are some unexplainable vibes about this tune that makes it purely comforting and warming. It has been several years since I discovered it and I still feel like i’m listening to it for the first time each time I’m playing it. This track is a complete journey from the start to the very end. I’m just in love with the drums, all the pads and synths but most of all the vocals that just lift the whole song to an amazing level.
