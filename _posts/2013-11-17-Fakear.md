  This morning, Fakear inspired me a mostly blue MaiTape. At first I wanted to
  balance it with some rough tracks but I couldn't get my hand on anything
  satisfying and finally decided to give you a full trip with a rush of
  adrenalin to wake you up in the end. Close your eyes and let the music guide
  your dreams.

<p id="introduction">This morning, [Fakear](https://www.facebook.com/fakear/) inspired me a mostly blue MaiTape. At first I wanted to balance it with some rough tracks but I couldn't get my hand on anything satisfying and finally decided to give you a full trip with a rush of adrenalin to wake you up in the end. Close your eyes and let the music guide your dreams.</p>

# Fakear, disciple of Wax Tailor.

Supporting Wax Tailor during his concert at the Trianon (Paris), Fakear surprised instantly the audience. What attracted me in his creations is his mastery in MPC combined with a peaceful atmosphere. It reminds me of some tracks by DJ Krush although the later evolves generally in darker landscapes. This consistency shows much maturity from his side and builds great expectations.


# Fakear's selection

+ ## O'Kobbo - The Only Thing To Do
_Fakear_: **"**This is an artist that I discovered last September, his only song touched me deeply and I was carried to atmospheres that could belong to Alt-J and Bonobo. It manages to create a very sweet and sincere emotion. Softness and pleasure. **"**

+ ## Bonobo - First Fires feat. Grey Reverend
_Fakear_: **"** Bonobo is my absolute reference. He manages to create textures with such small details that sometimes it takes three or four plays before you understand everything. It is very dense and deep, while remaining lightweight and sensitive. It's beautiful.**"**

+ ## Rone - Parade
_Fakear_: **"**This piece gently wakes all the senses one after the other. "Parade" with coffee, and the sun rises in your brain ! This is a piece that makes you feel good, very light and deep at the same time.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks, thanks to [Fakear](https://www.facebook.com/fakear/) and [Laurène Berchoteau](http://www.laureneberchoteau.com/) for the picture. I hope you'll dream well by listening to this episode. Love.</p>
