<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Adrian Dollemore of [Glockenspiel](https://babel-label.bandcamp.com/album/dupleix) to select three Sunday morning tunes for us on MailTape.
<br><br>
Using tapes, electronics and guitars through chains of effects, [Adrian Dollemore](https://twitter.com/AdeGlockenspiel)'s own music is hypnagogic—employing earth-ground chords and astrally-projective processing to paint a rural tonality with a fuzzy afterglow.<br><br></p>


# Vula Viels's selection

## King Ayisoba – Wicked Leaders
_Bex Burch_: **"**Kologo!!!! — this instrument and the Frafra players like King Ayisoba and Guy One have something FULL of fire and joy. Frafra makes my arms strong and heart heat up. I got to hang with mega Kolongo player, Steveo Atambire last month, hope to see his album out in the next couple of years as the new generation. This track: King Ayisoba's 'Wicked Leaders' brings some inspiring and challenging notes for a Sunday morning sermon. Wake up wake up!**"**

## Msafiri Zawose – Mazingira
_Bex Burch_: **"**I met Msafiri last year when he was in UK and love the album. Featuring some wonky-ass production from Sam Jones - his style and sound is another instrument and I love this collaboration. Shout out to Pendo Zawose on xylophone / voice / drum, and to all the female beat makers past, present and future.**"**

## Alain Péters/Caméléon – La Rosée Si Feulles Songes
_Bex Burch_: **"**There is no lazy Sunday list without without this Alain Péters/Caméléon tune.. La Rosée Si Feulles Songes.. let the insults comes and fall away like dews if leaves dream. The triangle groove, the snare, the organ, the panning, the space, every single sound.. delicious.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Vula Viel – Do Not Be Afraid
_Sanjay_: **"**A solo guitar edit taken from episode seven of The Endless Road Show, 'Disturbing The Peace', back in 2014. Once a duo and currently the solo project of [Adrian Dollemore](https://twitter.com/AdeGlockenspiel), [Glockenspiel](https://babel-label.bandcamp.com/album/dupleix) retains the glistening arpeggios, ethereal drone filigree and hypnotic, almost cathartic, rhythms.**"**

## Dengue Dengue Dengue – Semillero (feat. Mikongo)
_Sanjay_: **"**One of my favourite original composers working in the drone/ambient environments, this track from [Oren Ambarchi](https://orenambarchi.com/) is a seven-minute oasis of calm. The faux-piano notes fall like slow-motion rain that gently splashes between the thuds of thunderous bass like distant explosions.**"**

## Hailu Mergia – Shilela
_Sanjay_: **"**[Joanna Brouk](http://www.joannabrouk.com/) developed her work as a sound poet and performer during her studies with Terry Riley and Robert Ashley. She was a pioneer of electronic and new age music who explored the underlying sounds of words and their effects on the emotions and health. Following her death in April 2017, the [Numero label](http://numerogroup.com/) released the first major collection of Joanna’s work called '[Hearing Music](http://numerogroup.com/products/joanna-brouk-hearing-music)'. This warm and fuzzy track is taken from side A of her 1983 'Golden Swan' cassette. It is 15 minutes of minimalist piano music that tinkles like rain on a tin roof.**"**

## Rosie Turton – Butterfly
_Sanjay_: **"**[Maisha](https://maisha.bandcamp.com/album/there-is-a-place) is a London-based ensemble lead by drummer Jake Long playing original music inspired by the sounds of artists such as Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders. Gaining traction in the city's budding jazz scene, this is the eponymous track from their live 2016 EP—also featuring Nubya Garcia, Shirley Tetteh, Amane Suganami, Twm Dylan and Tim Doyle—which channels a vivid mixture of old jazz sensibilities and futuristic aesthetics to concoct otherworldly moments of musical joy.**"**
