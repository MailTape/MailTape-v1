This morning, discover [Seoul](https://www.facebook.com/SeoulMTL "Seoul's Facebook Fanpage"). Seoul is an ambient-pop aggregate from Montreal. Blue, breathless, gentle, absolute. Their selection will make you experience a very singular positively melancolic moment. We completed it with a similar atmospheric, but smoothly rising, set of tracks. Enjoy!

# Seoul's morning inspiration
 
## Oneohtrix Point Never - Nobody Here
_Seoul:_ **"**As a band that dives deeply into both writing and sampling interesting loops, we have to hand it to OPN for "Nobody Here". The sample he pulled here is a beauty and his choice to just let it run is really cool because that's what you actually want to happen. He's not worrying about being repetitive, it just is what it is and then it's gone.  Everyone has experienced that phenomenon of obsessing over a moment in a song and playing it back over and over. In this case, the one and only line, "There's nobody here", really just stands alone and creates a feeling completely independent of the original song.**"**
 
## Folk Implosion - Raise The Bells
_Seoul:_ **"**In the second to last scene of Kids, this endearingly cumbersome track materializes in a deliberate double-take of 6am downtown Manhattan, yielding the "nothing really matters" kind of vibe. Comprised of seemingly infinite layers of detuned-Casio-cassette-tape keyboards, this brief and innocent piece can be brought along in headphones to musically accompany your own pensive observations.**"**
 
## Ghost Town DJ's - My Boo
_Seoul:_ **"**One of the flagship tracks from the Miami bass era of the 90's, this song is one of our favorites to drop at any time, any place for literally any reason. Songs about new love always activate nostalgia and get you rooting for whoever is crushing on who. The earnestness and honest simplicity here keeps this jam an eternal one. Favorite lyric: "Every day I pray my heart can win".**"**
