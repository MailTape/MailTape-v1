# Anenon's morning inspiration
 
## John Roberts - Ausio
_Anenon:_ **"**Whenever I play this track on my monthly Dublab show one of the staff members in the office always asks me what it is. Elegant, drawn out and hitting at the same time, I can't get over how good this song is. It's a slight departure from his album Fences, which was one of my 2013 favorites, and I can't wait to hear where he goes next.**"**
 
## Bun (Fumitake Tamura) - la mer
_Anenon:_ **"**I'm not even sure of the track list on this, but this is 2014's quintessential late night mix for me. I know I hear some Debussy chords in the beginning, but I don't know about the rest. Bun is one of my favorite low key producers and this mix really sums up his vibe. I have very vivid and fond memories of staying at his house in a fishing village outside of Tokyo with Matthewdavid for a few days in late 2012. Putting this on instantly transports me back into his studio close to the Japanese sea.**"**
 
## Leyland Kirby - When We Parted My Heart Wanted To Die
_Anenon:_ **"**I think this song marks a point in my musical thinking with a clear pre and post Leyland Kirby listening divide. This was the first Kirby song that I had heard it and tore me apart at the time. It still does to some extent (along with the rest of this record, 'Sadly the Future is No Longer What it Was'), but this song in particular has such an intense emotional resonance to it that I find not many musicians can match.**"**
