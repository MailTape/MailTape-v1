<p id="introduction">Discovery is as vital to us as it is to humanity. When we discover music or a piece of art we revitalize MailTape as it is a life-giving experience for us.

Similarly and much in the same fashion when we discovered Brian Allen Simon, our artist of the week who goes by the name [Anenon](https://soundcloud.com/anenon "Anenon's SoundCloud"), we were thrilled by the swirling hypnotic sound of his sax and his almost instinctive ability to produce unique soundscapes.</p>


# Made a discovery yet?

After having made this discovery, we realized that it is easier to say that this never-ending loop of discovery is what advances us in every little step of ours while we do our best to unravel the truth that discoveries are not only important but quintessential to our existence.  With that said, We hope you come to our site this Sunday and discover Anenon. Enjoy !

# Anenon’s morning inspiration
 
## John Roberts - Ausio
_Anenon:_ **"**Whenever I play this track on my monthly Dublab show one of the staff members in the office always asks me what it is. Elegant, drawn out and hitting at the same time, I can't get over how good this song is. It's a slight departure from his album Fences, which was one of my 2013 favorites, and I can't wait to hear where he goes next.**"**
 
## Bun (Fumitake Tamura) - la mer
_Anenon:_ **"**Bun aka Fumitake Tamura makes quintessential late night music. He is one of my favorite low key producers. Micro sound meets sometimes beat textures that envelop the nocturnal psyche. I have very vivid and fond memories of staying at his house in a fishing village outside of Tokyo with Matthewdavid for a few days in late 2012. Putting this on instantly transports me back into his studio close to the Japanese sea.**"**
 
## Leyland Kirby - When We Parted My Heart Wanted To Die
_Anenon:_ **"**I think this song marks a point in my musical thinking with a clear pre and post Leyland Kirby listening divide. This was the first Kirby song that I had heard it and tore me apart at the time. It still does to some extent (along with the rest of this record, 'Sadly the Future is No Longer What it Was'), but this song in particular has such an intense emotional resonance to it that I find not many musicians can match.**"**
