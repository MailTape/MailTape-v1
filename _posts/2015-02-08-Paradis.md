<p id="introduction">Paradis is french for Paradise. Why paradis? Paradis is an ideal of happiness. A place where, what we do, what we say and what we produce stay true to our sensibilities. This is what led [Paradis](https://soundcloud.com/paradisfm "Paradis's SoundCloud") to make music. They like to refeer to their music as "the music they would have liked to listen to".</p>

# Idealistic music for idealistic people

Paradis is a french duo. They were initialy making musing on their own but after they met at a party, they decided to form Paradis. Their first track [La Ballade de Jim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB0h-PDoRYM) released on [Beats In Space](http://www.beatsinspace.net) received many compliments and let them to recently released their first EP [Couleurs Primaires](http://po.st/CouleursPrimairesiTunes). Couleurs Primaires is a first insite of their upcoming debut album. Their universe is not limited to music. You should definately check out their video clips [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWhR0RMcdfw), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCmnx-e928k), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OkN1m4AgIY) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8cZ6Vf2WY).

# Paradis’s morning inspiration
 
## Denis Sulta - A.A.L.A.S
_Paradis:_ **"**At the moment we’re starting all of our sets with this one! It’s just too hard to resist! We love the way it confronts sweet soul vocals with tough club beats.**"**
 
## Harvey Sutherland - Oscillate
_Paradis:_ **"**Our second track comes from a new record by Harvey Sutherland. His sound palette is beautiful on all the tracks from this record. Usually we buy a record for a particular track, it’s pretty rare for us to find one that we like from start to finish!**"**
 
## Secret Circuit - Foggy Twilights
_Paradis:_ **"**And last but not least, a short and effective summer anthem from Secret Circuit, who also released music on Beats In Space. Did someone say cocktails ?**"**

Enjoy your sunday.
