<p id="introduction">This morning, you can lay in bed for a few more minutes. Take it easy, brew a nice and warm coffee (or tea), pour it in your favorite mug and put on your comfy casual wear. Remember Sundays are the best days to take it easy and great the little joys of life while listening to smoothing tracks.</p>

# Mailtape wants to dance

When we first came across Papooz it was through their "Ann Wants To Dance" video clip filmed in Greece by the great Soko. Starring one of the cutest blondie on earth, Sasha Melnychuk, wearing her "You can undress now" tee-shirt, we got hooked by their rousing pop. We wanted to dance too, and so we did. 

Their music has this amazing power to make you move every inch of your body. From your toe to the tips of your fingers, you will find yourself whirling to their perky melodies.

# Papooz's selection:
 
## Mikhael Paskalev - Jailhouse Talk
Papooz: "_Sublime track by this wonderful man with a mustache. Ideal for heavy Sundays._"

## Little Joy - Don't Watch Me Dancing
Papooz: "_For a cold and sunny winter afternoon... To listen in your bath with your lover._"

## Matthew E. White - Love Is Deep
Papooz: " _Because we all need to love, especially on Sundays, and Matthew sings love with way more style that others. A mass._“
