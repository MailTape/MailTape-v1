<p id="introduction">This morning, we send each other love, we hug each other through our masks, we send each other kisses through our windows. You try to forget the dull days, the sad news and concentrate on memories of holidays, of moments spent surrounded by friends or family. To accompany us in this quest for the inner sun, we have the voice of Scherazade.

# Schérazade's selection

## Nick Hakim - Let it out 
Schérazade: **"**To wake up Nicely i listen this wonderful interlude but actually this is also my sunday album for sure.I love this artist that i discover recently, the flow the instrumental, this strange psyché feeling i mean i love everything. I really love my sunday vibe on Nick.**"**

## LA Priest - What Moves
Schérazade: **"**What a better day than Sunday to listen the new album of La Priest (Gene) I saw him on live in Paris he was alone with his instruments it was my best show ever for sure. I really like his music , it's very experimental a particular pop, and he's one of the best guitar player for me.**"**

Her voice seduced me, mixing such strength and incredible sensitivity, that one remains speechless in the face of this talent. A multifaceted artist, who released an album in February this year, "Asile Exquis". An EP that we would listen to a bit like an open book, perfect for this second confinement.**"**
