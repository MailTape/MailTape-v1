# Schérazade's selection

## Nick Hakim - Let it out 
Schérazade: **"**To wake up Nicely i listen this wonderful interlude but actually this is also my sunday album for sure.I love this artist that i discover recently, the flow the instrumental, this strange psyché feeling i mean i love everything. I really love my sunday vibe on Nick.**"**

## LA Priest - What Moves
Schérazade: **"**What a better day than Sunday to listen the new album of La Priest (Gene) I saw him on live in Paris he was alone with his instruments it was my best show ever for sure. I really like his music , it's very experimental a particular pop, and he's one of the best guitar player for me.**"**

## Flash & the pan Waiting for the sun
Schérazade: **"**This music help me do some homework, i do listen this track since i was teenager i really like to dance on it also. So Let's dance!**"**
