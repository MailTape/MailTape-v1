<p id="introduction"> 
This Sunday, we're extremely happy to start a new year of music discoveries with you and with Uzi Freyja. Prepare for an intense session, a crescendo of energy and vivacity. Music has and always be here, universal language from hearts to hearts. A vibration in the air, a light in the darkness. Let's keep that fire strong and alive, here and present. D a n c e.
