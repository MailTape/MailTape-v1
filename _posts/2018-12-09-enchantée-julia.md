<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome Dublin-based pianist [Utsav Lal](http://www.indianragapianist.com/) to pick three lilting Sunday morning musical selections for us.
<br><br>
Choosing to perform on an instrument that has traditionally been considered unsuitable for South Asian classical music, and often referred to as the ‘Raga Pianist’, Utsav’s handling of a raga blends his diverse musical influences. Ranging from the Persian piano playing tradition of Morteza Mahjoobi, the genre-bending piano playing of Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou and extended techniques of Helmut Lachenmann.
<br><br>
Performing on a completely acoustic grand piano allows Utsav to alter the individual frequencies of each note through a slider that varies the string tension. This makes the microtones much more accessible and the note can be bent and altered once played.</p>

# MailTape's selection

## Utsav Lal – Raga Puriya
_Sanjay_: **"**I really enjoy listening to Utsav's renditions of ragas on the piano. Particularly the ways in which he has discovered methods to approximate South Asian embellishments such as the 'meend' (glissando) and the 'shrutis' (microtones). This is a version of raga Puriya—a raga, he says, that he has explored a lot recently.**"**

## Jatinder Singh Durhailay — Tree
_Sanjay_: **"**As well as a painter and illustrator, [Jatinder Singh Durhailay](http://jatindersinghdurhailay.com/) is also trained in South Asian classical music, performing and practicing Kirtan as well as playing, among others, the rare instruments Dilruba and Taus.**"**

## Eve Risser – Yesterdays (Jerome Kern)
_Sanjay_: **"**A soothing solo piano rendition of Jerome Kern's 1933 song 'Yesterdays' by [Eve Risser](https://www.everisser.com/), with Boris Darley on sound. The original, with lyrics by Otto Harbach, was originally written for 'Roberta', a musical based on the novel 'Gowns by Roberta' by Alice Duer Miller.**"**

## Myra Melford – Park Mechanics
_Sanjay_: **"**A serial award-winner, pianist and composer [Myra Melford](http://www.myramelford.com/) opens this track with a jaunty demeanour, but it grows increasingly agitated with flurries of notes. Not unlike many of her contributions to some other projects, the melody is to be discovered in fractured glimpses seen between rhythmic lines.**"**
