<p id="introduction">This morning, we're everyday superheroes. We're trying to get back to a more "normal" life, little by little. Resume good habits by protecting yourself and others. And to accompany us in this new life, nothing like the group [Iñigo Montoya](https://soundcloud.com/i-igo-montoya-2) to whisper in our ears its desires and its revolution.
<br><br>
[Iñigo Montoya](https://inigomontoyaya.bandcamp.com/), I'm talking about here is not the main character of the movie "Princess Bride" with a moustache but is indeed a Parisian duo composed of Quentin Convard and Pierre Plantin, and joined on stage by Louis Delorme and David Baudart. On November 15th, he unveiled their "[InigEP03](https://inigomontoyaya.bandcamp.com/album/inigep03)", signed at [Echo Orange](http://www.echo-orange.fr/)! A surprising, provocative EP with a strong message to save what's left of this planet.

# Iñigo Montoya's selection

##  [Vitesse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitesse_(band)) - A Way To My Redemption 
Iñigo Montoya: **"**We don't know who is hiding behind this band. Sometimes the singer is out of tune or the keyboard is corny, but the sweet voice and melodies are calming you down. Start the day in a warm place, put some jam on your croissant (yes, we are French) on the small table of your small kitchen with the person you love... and this perfect song.**"**

##  Adrien Pallot - Quatre Sept 
Iñigo Montoya: **"**Adrien, a friend of us, released a beautiful ambient EP and remixed one of our song "Castration", recently. This track is beautiful if you wake up alone on a sunday morning and want to stay in bed with a book ! We tried it with « La Chute des corps » by [Druon](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Druon) and « [L’Art de perdre](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Art_de_perdre) » by [Zeniter](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Zeniter), and it works. But it seems to work with most of the books. The idea is : this track with a story you love.**"**

##  [The Blood Brothers](https://www.thebloodbrothers.com/) - Trash Flavored Trash 
Iñigo Montoya: **"**On Sunday, some of us are working (that's the case of Quentin), therefore a violent and hysterical track to wake up is not so bad. One of the greatest band of the 2000's by the way.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Iñigo Montoya](https://www.facebook.com/inigomontoyapark)  - .E.S
Anaïs G: **"**A nice project that makes sense. It's quite a symbol that Iñigo Montoya wanted to get through this piece. Commit to fighting violence against women through their music, by donating the profits from this song to the Maison des femmes de Saint Denis. If you listen closely you will recognize a speech by [Simone de Beauvoir](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir) and the Chilean song "[un violador es tu camino](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_violeur_sur_ton_chemin)" written by the Lastesis collective.**"**

## [Petit Fantôme](https://soundcloud.com/petit-fantome) - Je ne reviendrais pas
Anaïs G: **"**I discovered this artist 7 years ago with his track "Peio", a sweet and peositic title. I wanted to use his music to immerse myself in that atmosphere. &quot; I won't be coming back"; is poetically electrifying, so it's perfect for this selection.**"**

## [Jaune](https://soundcloud.com/jaunejaune) - La Lueur (Ankierman Remix)
Anaïs G: **"**Even if I really like the original of this music, this remix is just perfect. Electrifying, raw, metallic with a nice blackness that brings out "La Lueur" in something dark.**"**

## [Ricky Hollywood](https://soundcloud.com/ricky-hollywood) - Le sens du sens
Anaïs G: **"**This artist, who mixes kitsch and soul from the 70/80s with brio in her latest "[Le sens du sens](https://rickyhollywood.bandcamp.com/album/le-sens-du-sens)" released on April 10th. His world is as fascinating and crazy as this musical jewel!**"**
