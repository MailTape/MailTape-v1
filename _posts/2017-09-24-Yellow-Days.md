<p id="introduction">This morning, we keep it smooth and easy with this delicate indie selection made with the talented 17 years old [Yellow Days](https://soundcloud.com/yellow-days), aka George Van Den Broek. Autumn just started 3 days ago, let’s stay in bed a little longer and plan our next vacation... </p>

# Electro I love you but sometimes...
... you drag me down. Your synth and loops are great to help me fly high and dance until the next day, but as winter approaches I need some warmth. The gentle riffs of a guitar and the uniqueness of a human voice make my soul much easier in this harsh atmosphere.

Yellow Days’ music has been an obsession of mine for a few months now, especially when I need that kind of comfortable space in my head. I’ve been waiting for weeks to share this episode with you, looking for the perfectly balanced selection.

So here’s to you, hopefully you’ll find as much, if not more, inspiration in it than I.

# **Yellow Days' selection**

+ ## Run DMT - Romantic
_Yellow Days_: **"**Beautiful guitar tones, enough soul for a sunday morning cry.**"**

+ ## Aldous RH - U and ME
_Yellow Days_: **"**For me the sound is so smooth it makes my knees weak and that's a nice way to start a sunday.**"**

+ ## Made in M - Goodday
_Yellow Days_: **"**Lil' lo-fi cube sample, real tight beat. an easy listen for an easy sunday.**"**


# MailTape's selection

+ ## Yellow Days - Hurt In Love
_ImaCrea_: **"**Right to the heart. Track after each track, Yellow Days keeps exploring a rich soundscape driven by pure emotion.**"**  

+ ## Oliverpalfreyman - Females
_ImaCrea_: **"**Slow down, keep it cool this morning. This one is for you to stay one more track in your comfy bed in these early days of Autumn.**"**

+ ## Mattiel - Count Your Blessings
_ImaCrea_: **"**Instantly memorable, reminiscence of Nancy Sinatra. Gosh I love so much Burger Records...**"**

+ ## Amber Cruz - Psychedelic Candy
_ImaCrea_: **"**Rare gem I discovered by chance on a late night. Couldn't discern if I was dreaming or if this angel voice was really coming from my speakers. Smooth and delicate voice. Direct connection to the soul.**"**
