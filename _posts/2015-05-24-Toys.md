<p id="introduction">Today, discover [TOYS](https://soundcloud.com/toys-music "TOYS' Soundcloud stream")' eclectic selection and enjoy their very inspirational episode where pop, electronic, indie music and vintage sounds will help you make the most of this day.</p>

Led by Paul Prier and Benoît Doremus, TOYS is mainly a family story
that started in a Parisian studio, which quickly became the band's new second home. A story that thrives on common foundations and a passion for electronic music, from Space to Kevin Saunderson, including Pink Floyd and Jay Dee.

In the beginning, there was [Noise](https://soundcloud.com/toys-music/noise "Noise by TOYS on Soundcloud"), their first single released two years ago, featured on "Kitsuné Parisien 3" compilation. Then, a few months later came [Hey Boy](https://soundcloud.com/toys-music/hey-boy-1 "Hey Boy by TOYS on Soundcloud"), a little gem of electronic production with soulful accents.

After releasing several remixes (Two Door Cinema Club, Breton, Lescop, François & the Atlas Mountain), they now come back with their brand new EP, as well as a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F7-mqFbSYA "Golden Line music video on YouTube") directed by Vladimir de Fontenay for the single 'Golden Line'. The video was featured in the South by Southwest Film Festival (SXSW - Texas) this year.


# TOYS' morning inspiration

## Donnie & Joe Emerson - Baby
_TOYS:_ **"**A track that we often listen to. This song has a rather improbable story : it was recorded in the late 70's by two brothers Joe and Donnie. Their father, producer of the band, built a studio in the family farm to produce his sons' music. At the time, their album wasn't much of a success at all and the band was completely forgotten until a record collector rediscovered the vinyl in 2008 in a flea market !
There is something touching in this track : the production is a bit awkward but its heartfelt songwriting and its interpretation turn it into a soul masterpiece...**"**

## Unknown Mortal Orchestra - Multi-Love
_TOYS:_ **"**We like everything in this track : the way drums and vocals are processed, the psychedelic-pop energy mixed with a touch of house music, the overall production... Their new album is about to be released in a couple of days, we are really looking forward to listening to it !**"**

## Spooky Black - Without You
_TOYS:_ **"**A young 16-year-old american prodigy. Part of a completely autonomous generation of artists, he is also a member of [the stand4rd](https://soundcloud.com/thestand4rd "the stand4rd's soundcloud stream"), a promising rapping crew. We love this simple and beautiful piece, almost hard to believe that it was done by such a young person...**"**
