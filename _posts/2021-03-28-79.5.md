# 79.5's selection

## [Aretha Franklin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majida_El_Roumi) - Don't Let Me Lose This Dream
79.5: **"**I mean, Aretha. What an angel. This song reminds me to never give up, and to always sing from my heart. It’s just so beautiful and classic.**"**

## [John Prine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Mouskouri) – Angel From Montgomery
79.5: **"**My Sunday mornings have always been heavy on the country music, due to me being a complete radio junkie. Putting John Prine on any time is the best, but putting him on Sunday is cathartic. He was an American Treasure, RIP to a great one.**"**

## [Gloria Ann Taylor](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Azzam) - Love Is A Hurtin’ Thing 12” Version
79.5: **"**Ok, so the 12” version is where it’s at!! It’s 7:16 of pure groovy psychedelic and disco soul. A go-to dancing and cleaning the shit outta my apartment track for me! Also, as a pianist, I’m into the octave jumps that are so pertinent to this track.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [79.5](https://www.facebook.com/sarahmaison/)  – Predictions
Sarah: **"**This track is the namesake for 79.5's 2018 album, [Predictions](https://79point5.bandcamp.com/album/predictions). As 79.5 explains, this track was cut live to tape, capturing the magic of live performance. From the beginning with the flowing soul in those chords and verses, a whole mood is created effortlessly. The spiraling flute takes the track to new heights, leaning the track into the psychedelic expressions of the 70's.**"**

## [79.5](https://www.facebook.com/leoniepernetmusic/) Tall Black Guy Bounce Remix – Terrorize My Heart
Sarah: **"**The drums in this!! 79.5 describes this track as a goodbye to an ex lover-- where after leaving, all she wanted was to dance. This remix definitely feels like an homage to that state of mind, the vocals melt together like silk and the synth movement is absolutely contagious. Love the pause and attention paid to the flute accents, such a cool melding of sound. **"**

## [Altin Gün](https://www.facebook.com/altingunband) – Ordunun Dereleri
Sarah: **"**I discovered the group Altin Gün during their stay at [the Transmusicales de Rennes](https://www.lestrans.com/) in 2017. It mixes pop and folk sounds to the Turkish psyche which gives that groove to their music. Their latest EP “[Yol](https://altingun.bandcamp.com/album/yol)”, released last February, promises surprises and musical nuggets like “[Ordunun Dereleri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLMYfvbZzTE)” playing with synths in a mystical atmosphere.**"**

## [Cyril Cyril](https://www.facebook.com/cyrilcyrilband/) – Al Boustane
Sarah: **"**Cyril Cyril is a duo from Geneva, that I knew with their track "Sayyara" from their first album "[Certaine Ruines](https://cyrilcyril.bandcamp.com/album/certaine-ruines)", released on [Born Bad Records](https://www.bornbadrecords.net/). Cyril Cyril, it's different emotions with each song. Their music gives off a kind of trance almost immediate when you listen to it, you go from smiles to tears, from hope to worry... All this led by psychedelic sounds and a lot of percussions that make the borders explode. Their latest album "[Yallah Mickey Mouse](https://cyrilcyril.bandcamp.com/album/yallah-mickey-mouse)" brings all this together and more with mystical and indescribable aspects. You have to listen to it to believe it!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us. Our love to Sarah Maison for their wonderful Sunday selections and to Jason Pridham for this episode's inspiring illustration.</p>
