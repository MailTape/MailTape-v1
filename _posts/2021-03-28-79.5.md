<p id="introduction">This morning, we leave in the sun with a one-way trip to the Eastern countries. The beauty of language, culture and scenery. . . In this episode, [Sarah Maison](https://sarahmaison.bandcamp.com/) will bring back some sunshine to our homes and apartments while waiting for better days. 
<br><br>
With her incredible aura and pop with Arabic sounds, Sarah Maison looks like a muse or summer goddess. In her latest EP "Soleils", released on March 19, she offers us a moment of fullness and warmth. A capsule of happiness in this world after plunged into a long infinite sleep.

# 79.5's selection

## [Aretha Franklin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majida_El_Roumi) - Don't Let Me Lose This Dream
79.5: **"**I mean, Aretha. What an angel. This song reminds me to never give up, and to always sing from my heart. It’s just so beautiful and classic.**"**

## [John Prine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Mouskouri) – Angel From Montgomery
79.5: **"**My Sunday mornings have always been heavy on the country music, due to me being a complete radio junkie. Putting John Prine on any time is the best, but putting him on Sunday is cathartic. He was an American Treasure, RIP to a great one.**"**

## [Gloria Ann Taylor](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Azzam) - Love Is A Hurtin’ Thing 12” Version
79.5: **"**Ok, so the 12” version is where it’s at!! It’s 7:16 of pure groovy psychedelic and disco soul. A go-to dancing and cleaning the shit outta my apartment track for me! Also, as a pianist, I’m into the octave jumps that are so pertinent to this track.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [79.5](https://www.facebook.com/sarahmaison/)  – Predictions
Sarah: **"**The first time I heard Sarah Maison was with her track "[Western Arabisant](https://sarahmaison.bandcamp.com/track/western-arabisant)" on [the OUF compilation](https://souterraine.biz/album/ouf-lanthologie-souterraine-2015-2017) of the label [La Souterraine](https://souterraine.biz/). Hypnotic as can be! In March 2018, when her self-titled EP was released, she had me dancing to her track "[Muzul](https://sarahmaison.bandcamp.com/album/sarah-maison)" with her particular brand of radiance and bringing the sunshine. His latest EP "Soleils", released on March 19th, is a breath of fresh air and the ray of sunshine we've been waiting for in our lives for a year.**"**

## [Léonie Pernet](https://www.facebook.com/leoniepernetmusic/) feat [Hanaa Ouassim](https://soundcloud.com/hanaa-ouassim) – Auaati
Sarah: **"**Dismissing, poetic and engaging, this music is incredibly beautiful. I discovered this song at the release of Léonie Pernet’s “[Crave](https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/crave)” album. A mix of sounds that can surprise and different atmospheres that confront each other. A perfect balance for this beautiful song.**"**

## [Altin Gün](https://www.facebook.com/altingunband) – Ordunun Dereleri
Sarah: **"**I discovered the group Altin Gün during their stay at [the Transmusicales de Rennes](https://www.lestrans.com/) in 2017. It mixes pop and folk sounds to the Turkish psyche which gives that groove to their music. Their latest EP “[Yol](https://altingun.bandcamp.com/album/yol)”, released last February, promises surprises and musical nuggets like “[Ordunun Dereleri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLMYfvbZzTE)” playing with synths in a mystical atmosphere.**"**

## [Cyril Cyril](https://www.facebook.com/cyrilcyrilband/) – Al Boustane
Sarah: **"**Cyril Cyril is a duo from Geneva, that I knew with their track "Sayyara" from their first album "[Certaine Ruines](https://cyrilcyril.bandcamp.com/album/certaine-ruines)", released on [Born Bad Records](https://www.bornbadrecords.net/). Cyril Cyril, it's different emotions with each song. Their music gives off a kind of trance almost immediate when you listen to it, you go from smiles to tears, from hope to worry... All this led by psychedelic sounds and a lot of percussions that make the borders explode. Their latest album "[Yallah Mickey Mouse](https://cyrilcyril.bandcamp.com/album/yallah-mickey-mouse)" brings all this together and more with mystical and indescribable aspects. You have to listen to it to believe it!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thank you so much for joining us. Our love to Sarah Maison for their wonderful Sunday selections and to Jason Pridham for this episode's inspiring illustration.</p>
