# 79.5's selection

## [Aretha Franklin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majida_El_Roumi) - Don't Let Me Lose This Dream
79.5: **"**I mean, Aretha. What an angel. This song reminds me to never give up, and to always sing from my heart. It’s just so beautiful and classic.**"**

## [John Prine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Mouskouri) – Angel From Montgomery
79.5: **"**My Sunday mornings have always been heavy on the country music, due to me being a complete radio junkie. Putting John Prine on any time is the best, but putting him on Sunday is cathartic. He was an American Treasure, RIP to a great one.**"**

## [Gloria Ann Taylor](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Azzam) - Love Is A Hurtin’ Thing 12” Version
79.5: **"**Ok, so the 12” version is where it’s at!! It’s 7:16 of pure groovy psychedelic and disco soul. A go-to dancing and cleaning the shit outta my apartment track for me! Also, as a pianist, I’m into the octave jumps that are so pertinent to this track.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [79.5](https://www.facebook.com/sarahmaison/)  – Predictions
Sarah: **"**This track is the namesake for 79.5's 2018 album, [Predictions](https://79point5.bandcamp.com/album/predictions). As 79.5 explains, this track was cut live to tape, capturing the magic of live performance. From the beginning with the flowing soul in those chords and verses, a whole mood is created effortlessly. The spiraling flute takes the track to new heights, leaning the track into the psychedelic expressions of the 70's.**"**

## [Lynda Dawn](https://www.facebook.com/altingunband) Mndsgn Remix – Fonk Street
Sarah: **"**Obsessed with this track's progression, it spins Lynda Dawn's original (delightful in its own right) funk-psychedelic track into something cosmic and haunting, especially once Mndsgn isolates Dawn's celestial vocals. The deep bass that drives the background's comeback makes the return of sound that more powerful. This track's chosen color is trippy for a reason ;)**"**

## [79.5](https://www.facebook.com/leoniepernetmusic/) Tall Black Guy Bounce Remix – Terrorize My Heart
Sarah: **"**The drums in this!! 79.5 describes this track as a goodbye to an ex lover-- where after leaving, all she wanted was to dance. This remix definitely feels like an homage to that state of mind, the vocals melt together like silk and the synth movement is absolutely contagious. Love the pause and attention paid to the flute accents, such a cool melding of sound. **"**

## [Cyril Cyril](https://www.facebook.com/cyrilcyrilband/) – Al Boustane
Sarah: **"**A dreamy track to finish off this morning's selection :) **"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! As always, thank you so much for listening with us. So much love to 79.5 for their fantastic Sunday selections and to Jason Pridham for this episode's psychedelic illustration :)</p>
