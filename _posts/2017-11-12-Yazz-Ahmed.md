<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to collaborate with trumpeter and composer [Yazz Ahmed](http://yazzahmed.com/) and get a glimpse into her Sunday morning jukebox with MailTape.</p>
<p>As well as leading her own quartet and septet, Yazz has also recorded and performed with Radiohead, Max Romeo, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry, ABC, Swing Out Sister, Joan as Police Woman and Amel Zen.</p>
<p>For our friends in Paris and London, Yazz will be performing with the Hafla Band at the [Blue Note Festival](http://www.bluenotefestival.fr/) on 16th November and at [King's Place](http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/music/yazz-ahmed-la-saboteuse#.WgbNH7CFjfY) in London on the 17th.</p>


# Yazz Ahmed's selection



## Sarathy Korwar – Bismillah
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**I love [Sarathy](http://www.sarathykorwar.com/)’s playing and compositions and his choice of musicians. This track, to me, feels like an invitation to enter a beautiful spiritual place. The opening is like a simple morning prayer which develops and intensifies into a celebration. We are waking, moving and dancing into the new day.**"**

## Samuel Hällkvist – Variety Of Rhythm Part 4: "The Necker Cube”
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**I’ve been a fan of [Samuel](http://samuelhallkvist.com/) and his music ever since we met, back in 2012. This angular, precisely metric and intriguing piece is very typical of Samuel’s compositions: mysterious, menacing and fun. I like the contasting elements, the broken drum beats, floating on a bed of sonorous guitar, decorated with vibraphone and violin interjections. It reminds me of an impressionist painting. Then, in the middle of the piece, the sun rises and the pace starts to quicken. The rhythmic constraints are broken with an overwhelming surge of expressive freedom.**"**

## Ruth Wall – Snow Clamp
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**A collaboration between harpist, [Ruth Wall](http://sound-scotland.co.uk/profile/wall-ruth), and composer [Graham Fitkin](http://fitkin.com/)—both musicians and composers I greatly admire. This piece beautifully integrates electronic effects with the elegant sounds of the harp. It starts very gently, with a thoughtful mediation, then progresses with increasing momentum by the addition of reversed loops and clouds of processed drums. It makes me feel that I’m falling, tumbling, running, in a dream, then with a sudden stop… awake!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Yazz Ahmed — La Saboteuse
_Sanjay_: **"**It's pretty challenging for me to pick just one track from Yazz's latest album, 'La Saboteuse'. In this atmospheric title track the tension between the quiet bass clarinet and gentle percussion create a foreboding effect. Perfect for an autumnal morning.**"**

## Fran & Flora – The Hollow Tree
_Sanjay_: **"**The first time I saw [Fran & Flora](https://www.franandflora.com/) in London we were treated to a Romani a capella sung in harmony, along with anecdotes about their musical adventures in Eastern Europe. I'm looking forward to their upcoming debut album. Such a cool duo!**"**

## Zoe Rahman — Shiraz
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from pianist [Zoe Rahman](http://www.zoerahman.com/). I've seen her perform a few times in London and Leicester and I love the rhythmic ruminations with repeating low themes emerging in the gaps between treble trills in this track. If you're in London, she'll be performing [solo at lunchtime on 13th November](https://www.pizzaexpresslive.com/whats-on/zoe-rahman) as part of this year's jazz festival.**"**

## Vijay Iyer — Break Stuff
_Sanjay_: **"**With all this talk of gaps, between revision and the break, we try to remain in passage and resist drawing conlcusions with this title track from an album by the [Vijay Iyer Trio](http://vijay-iyer.com/) explicitly delighting in the breaks. If you haven't done so already, I'd recommend hearing Vijay—alongside his many ensembles—live!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today. Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Yazz Ahmed](http://yazzahmed.com/) for being our guest, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
