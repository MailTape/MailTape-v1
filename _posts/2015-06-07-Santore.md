# Santoré's morning inspiration

## Dear Paula - Boussole
_Santoré:_ **"**Dear Pola is a project we love, the voice of Mary is beautiful, a sort of mix between Bon iver and Polica . She participated to the Inrocks Labs Open Mics last April , it's nice for her.**"**

## Ellis Farway - Saiga
_Santoré:_ **"**We discovered this artist by chance on Soundcloud. We felt close to his universe. A lot of acoustic guitars in an ambient backdrop and a permanent incentive trip...**"**

## Pavane - La Danse de Daphni
_Santoré:_ **"**A very nice track, simple but powerful. We feel pretty close to the way Pavane is working, with a lot of progression and emotion. The song title is well chosen too.**"**
