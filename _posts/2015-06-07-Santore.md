<p id="introduction">This morning, we will all take a step back while we tune into the sounds of our artist of the week, [Santoré](https://soundcloud.com/santoremusic "Santoré's Soundcloud stream"). The duo has recently released a new EP called “Silverado” and much like their sounds it reminisces the warmth and fragility of our long gone childhood.</p>

# Tender recollections

Santore has beautifully brought out the essence through the innocence of our childhood. Their music is the plane where they give impressions to sounds they create. And as you step into it, you’re touched by the tender recollections of the past while subtly lapsing into a childlike state.

# Santoré's morning inspiration

## Pavane - La Danse de Daphni
_Santoré:_ **"**A very nice track, simple but powerful. We feel pretty close to the way Pavane is working, with a lot of progression and emotion. The song title is well chosen too.**"**

## Dear Paula - Boussole
_Santoré:_ **"**Dear Pola is a project we love, the voice of Mary is beautiful, a sort of mix between Bon iver and Polica . She participated in the Inrocks Labs Open Mics last April , it's nice for her.**"**

## Ellis Farway - Saiga
_Santoré:_ **"**We discovered this artist by chance on Soundcloud. We felt close to his universe. A lot of acoustic guitars in an ambient backdrop and a call to an endless trip...**"**
