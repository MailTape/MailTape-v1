<p id="introduction">
	This morning, we are delighted to welcome Dear Nora to MailTape :) 
	<br><br>
  Based in Sydney, Aleesha Dibbs joins us after the release of her debut solo EP, [Paradise Lost](https://soundcloud.com/aleeshadibbs) - produced and co-written by [Tom Crandles](https://www.instagram.com/____prudence/). Marked by eccentric synthwork and rich vocals, the release often treads into darker, haunting tones with exceptional inventiveness.

# Dear Nora's selection

## [Mecca Normal](https://www.solseppy.world/test) - I Walk Alone

Dear Nora: **"**This song features a truly unparalleled vocal performance from Jean Smith and potently restrained guitar performance from David Lester. The minimalism makes it impossible to look away. The lyrics explore some of my absolute favorite things – travel/movement and cosmic connection. The performance is punk, so beautiful, and very deep. I wish I recorded this.**"**

## [Henry Mancini](https://www.davidbowie.com/news) - Two for the Road

Dear Nora: **"**This is the most incredible track from Bowie's final and very potent album. I ended up in a music video watching Youtube portal the other night and was in tears re-watching the 'Black Star' clip - to think his health was suffering so severely whilst in the process of making the record, and that he left the world just two days after it's release is overwhelming. His artistic integrity and genius was so powerful literally up until his final body of work.**"**

## [Najat Al Saghira](https://laurajeanmusic.bandcamp.com/) - Ana Bashaa El Bahr

Dear Nora: **"**This song reaches down to the core of the Earth. It’s utterly transfixing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Aleesha Dibbs](https://www.instagram.com/aleeshadibbs/?hl=en-gb) - Comin For Me Now

Sarah: **"**Across Paradise Lost, the intricacy within the EP's synthwork carries such brooding richness, weaving the four songs into their own epic and drawing listeners deeper with each track. [Comin For Me Now](https://soundcloud.com/aleeshadibbs/comin-for-me-now) is the last of these tracks. As Dibbs describes, the creation of the EP embodied a "monstrous two years" and it symbolized "a big, happy, metaphorical closing of a door." The description is especially interesting when experiencing [Comin For Me Now](https://soundcloud.com/aleeshadibbs/comin-for-me-now) as the EP's final number, the last word before the metaphorical door's closing. Although the last word, this track strikes at once haunting and then accelerating tones, a chasing of sorts. With each listen through the EP, I felt drawn to begin again, to go back to Battalion, through to Distance, on to Conjured You Up, and found myself embedded in the spiral of these tracks, their connective tissue and the emotional weight they came to represent.**"**

## [Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys](https://www.caitlinharnett.com/) - Only Dreaming

Sarah: **"**From the Sydney-based band's new album release, [All Night Long](https://www.caitlinharnett.com/product/vinyl-pre-order-all-night-long/27?cp=true&sa=true&sbp=false&q=false&utm_source=Original&utm_campaign=CaitlinHarnett%26ThePonyBoysEvenCowgirlsCry-Single20230821&utm_medium=channel.utm_medium&utm_referrer=direct&utm_board=spunk-records&utm_country=AU&utm_linkurl=caitlinharnett.lnk.to%2FAllNightLong). Drawn to the nostalgia laced over this soulful Americana style, love this track's pickup and solo toward its end. Adding more mist to this Sunday morning haze :)**"**

## [Anastasia Rydlevskaya](https://www.instagram.com/arydlevskaya_art/) - Don't tell her your name

Sarah: **"**Highly recommend listening through Polish artist Anastasia Rydlevskaya's discography while viewing [her visual art](https://www.saatchiart.com/arydlevskaya), as she writes that she makes her music with deliberate connection to its visual counterpart. Just as her art engages with surrealism, gender nonbinary themes, and mental health, her music holds complex and intertwined harmonies, unpredictable melodies, and celestial overtones.**"**

## [Vanishing Twin](https://www.vanishingtwin.co.uk/) - Afternoon X

Sarah: **"**Fascinated by this new release from Vanishing Twin, the namesake of their album released earlier this month. The cyclical rhythm section is disrupted and then enhanced, hypnotic in its creativity and subtle transformations.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s all for this morning! Thank you for joining us. Our love to Aleesha Dibbs for her eclectic selection, and to Camille Célestin for this episode's beautiful illustration. Until next Sunday :)</p>
