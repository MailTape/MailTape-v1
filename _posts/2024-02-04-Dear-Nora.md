<p id="introduction">
	This morning, we are delighted to welcome Katy Davidson from Dear Nora to MailTape :) They join us just after the announcement of their USA tour and the release of their human futures album. Dear Nora's discography crosses into folk, punk, ambient, and experimental textures; never dwelling too long in either one. 
	<br><br>
  human futures arrives 6 years after their 2018 album, Skulls Example. The record is rich with descriptions of nature and tenderness, but also of our place in deep time. Navigating topics from the technosphere to climate to the mist of memories, Dear Nora's standout lyricism is meshed with creative rhythmic and melodic backdrops, swaying from futuristic synthwork to earthy acoustics.

# Dear Nora's selection

## [Mecca Normal](https://www.solseppy.world/test) - I Walk Alone

Dear Nora: **"**This song features a truly unparalleled vocal performance from Jean Smith and potently restrained guitar performance from David Lester. The minimalism makes it impossible to look away. The lyrics explore some of my absolute favorite things – travel/movement and cosmic connection. The performance is punk, so beautiful, and very deep. I wish I recorded this.**"**

## [Henry Mancini](https://www.davidbowie.com/news) - Two for the Road

Dear Nora: **"**This is the most incredible track from Bowie's final and very potent album. I ended up in a music video watching Youtube portal the other night and was in tears re-watching the 'Black Star' clip - to think his health was suffering so severely whilst in the process of making the record, and that he left the world just two days after it's release is overwhelming. His artistic integrity and genius was so powerful literally up until his final body of work.**"**

## [Najat Al Saghira](https://laurajeanmusic.bandcamp.com/) - Ana Bashaa El Bahr

Dear Nora: **"**This song reaches down to the core of the Earth. It’s utterly transfixing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

Sarah: **"**One of my favorite tracks on the human futures record (a difficult task to separate just one, as it feels embedded as one with the songs surrounding it -- the sudden drop at this song's end lifted by fruitful streams just following with a bright swaying rhythm). The lyrics, _My dad died many times years ago // Now on the table staring at the light // I move from grief to joy_ paints such an immediate, wrenching emotional picture, bringing us into the world of the song with storm clouds rolling in and semi-trance. 

humming through the crisis of different themes 
waves of life 
vocals are tender

I like the sudden end of this, we're dropped into the next track quickly**"**

## [Caitlin Harnett & The Pony Boys](https://www.caitlinharnett.com/) - Only Dreaming

Sarah: **"**From the Sydney-based band's new album release, [All Night Long](https://www.caitlinharnett.com/product/vinyl-pre-order-all-night-long/27?cp=true&sa=true&sbp=false&q=false&utm_source=Original&utm_campaign=CaitlinHarnett%26ThePonyBoysEvenCowgirlsCry-Single20230821&utm_medium=channel.utm_medium&utm_referrer=direct&utm_board=spunk-records&utm_country=AU&utm_linkurl=caitlinharnett.lnk.to%2FAllNightLong). Drawn to the nostalgia laced over this soulful Americana style, love this track's pickup and solo toward its end. Adding more mist to this Sunday morning haze :)**"**

## [Anastasia Rydlevskaya](https://www.instagram.com/arydlevskaya_art/) - Don't tell her your name

Sarah: **"**Highly recommend listening through Polish artist Anastasia Rydlevskaya's discography while viewing [her visual art](https://www.saatchiart.com/arydlevskaya), as she writes that she makes her music with deliberate connection to its visual counterpart. Just as her art engages with surrealism, gender nonbinary themes, and mental health, her music holds complex and intertwined harmonies, unpredictable melodies, and celestial overtones.**"**

## [Dear Nora](https://www.instagram.com/aleeshadibbs/?hl=en-gb) - fruitful streams

Sarah: **"**the last track of a beautiful album 
the dripping of water - percussives 
the mechanical sound of keys moving 
**"**

<p id="outroduction">That’s all for this morning! Thank you for joining us. Our love to Aleesha Dibbs for her eclectic selection, and to Camille Célestin for this episode's beautiful illustration. Until next Sunday :)</p>
