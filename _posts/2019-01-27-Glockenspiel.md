<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Adrian Dollemore of [Glockenspiel](https://babel-label.bandcamp.com/album/dupleix) to select three Sunday morning tunes for us on MailTape.
<br><br>
Using tapes, electronics and guitars through chains of effects, [Adrian Dollemore](https://twitter.com/AdeGlockenspiel)'s own music is hypnagogic—employing earth-ground chords and astrally-projective processing to paint a rural tonality with a fuzzy afterglow.<br><br></p>


# Glockenspiel's selection

## [Dedekind Cut](https://soundcloud.com/leebannon/) – Tahoe
_Adrian Dollemore_: **"**A beautiful atmospheric synth/string piece. Really simple and looping but it's one of those hooks that really stun you. I'd love to hear it really loud through a good P.A. I believe he played at one of those all night shows in eastern Europe that you can sleep at, which must have been incredible, if you weren't actually alseep. Or maybe even if you were! **"**

## [Shida Shahabi](https://shidashahabi.com/) – Abisme
_Adrian Dollemore_: **"**I've only discovered her music recently. She's a Swedish/Iranian Pianist. I was blown away by the level of texture on her  album. At a guess it probably results from clever micing of her piano but there's something utterly beguiling about the minimalism. There's an element of Satie and French romantic, but as much as I like both of those, this goes way beyond. Completely enchanting.**"**

## Ancient Colours – Field and Woodland Strewn, the Failing Sun
_Adrian Dollemore_: **"**This is by Simon Allum. A friend of mine whose guitar playing I enjoy very much. I recorded his album for the [Preserved Sound](http://www.preservedsound.com/) label a few years ago but wasn't involved with this one. This is a longer piece and I like how it stretches out and ebbs and flows over ten minutes or so without any augmentation from other instruments. Keeping sole space for the guitar to unfold, which it certainly does. There's some lovely picking going on, he really knows his tunings. Hopefully he will make some more!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Glockenspiel – The Endless Road 2
_Sanjay_: **"**A solo guitar edit taken from episode seven of The Endless Road Show, 'Disturbing The Peace', back in 2014. Once a duo and currently the solo project of [Adrian Dollemore](https://twitter.com/AdeGlockenspiel), [Glockenspiel](https://babel-label.bandcamp.com/album/dupleix) retains the glistening arpeggios, ethereal drone filigree and hypnotic, almost cathartic, rhythms.**"**

## Oren Ambarchi – The Strouhal Number
_Sanjay_: **"**One of my favourite original composers working in the drone/ambient environments, this track from [Oren Ambarchi](https://orenambarchi.com/) is a seven-minute oasis of calm. The faux-piano notes fall like slow-motion rain that gently splashes between the thuds of thunderous bass like distant explosions.**"**

## Joanna Brouk – Going Through the Veil: Becoming a Swan
_Sanjay_: **"**[Joanna Brouk](http://www.joannabrouk.com/) developed her work as a sound poet and performer during her studies with Terry Riley and Robert Ashley. She was a pioneer of electronic and new age music who explored the underlying sounds of words and their effects on the emotions and health. Following her death in April 2017, the [Numero label](http://numerogroup.com/) released the first major collection of Joanna’s work called '[Hearing Music](http://numerogroup.com/products/joanna-brouk-hearing-music)'. This warm and fuzzy track is taken from side A of her 1983 'Golden Swan' cassette. It is 15 minutes of minimalist piano music that tinkles like rain on a tin roof.**"**

## Maisha – Welcome To A New Welcome
_Sanjay_: **"**[Maisha](https://maisha.bandcamp.com/album/there-is-a-place) is a London-based ensemble lead by drummer Jake Long playing original music inspired by the sounds of artists such as Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders. Gaining traction in the city's budding jazz scene, this is the eponymous track from their live 2016 EP—also featuring Nubya Garcia, Shirley Tetteh, Amane Suganami, Twm Dylan and Tim Doyle—which channels a vivid mixture of old jazz sensibilities and futuristic aesthetics to concoct otherworldly moments of musical joy.**"**
