# Mydgar's selection

## Rival Consoles - Recovery
Mydgar: **"**There is absolutely all the things I love in this track. Sometimes, when you produce music, you tend to add new elements to fill a lack of something instead of pushing one element and make it interesting. For me, in this track, Rival Consoles perfectly manages to sublimate the main lead with a super creative use and treats of it. It result a kind of minimalist track with the main lead as a guideline, I love it !**"**

## Melawati - Daliah
Mydgar: **"**This track is epic and full of story, it brings a lot of images to my mind... that's exactly what I'm looking for when listening to or producing music, well done Melawati !**"**

## Against All Logic - Fantasy
Mydgar: **"**I really like this side project of Nicolas Jaar. It might sound a little harder to listen to but the more I listen to it the more I discover things in this track... itâ€™s like a movie you need to see twice of more! The way he uses saturation and sampling in this track is completely unbelievable !**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Mydgar - Late Night
Sarah : **"**Love the punchy quality of these retro synths, something of a signature for Mydgar's releases. These movements underlay the space for the rest of the track's flight, weaving in betweeen and underneath the percussives and lead synths. Mydgar's experimentation with drumming basslines (surrounding us all at once and then disappearing, only to move ahead with momentum once again) contribute to the melancholic energy within the track. Indeed, Mydgar describes how he wrote the track in one of the darkest periods of quarantine, and the melody reflects this headspace. However, toward the track's end, there seems to be a sort of revealation, the melancholy appears to lift, on its way to brighter places after a late night.**"**

## Kadhja Bonet - For You (Many Selves Version)
Sarah: **"**Kadhja keeps pushing her art and never disappoint. Smells like a new album is coming this year. You can count on me, "I'll be there for you".**"**

## Mozaik - Assembly
Sarah: **"**The namesake of Mozaik's most recent EP (2021 release). The track maintains much of the standard club structure while also opening up opportunities for synth experimentation. A wonderful progression to listen through, we notice many of the signature movements seen in Mydgar's solo work (especially sharp analog synth leads to complement and celestial synths) **"**

## Ibibio Sound Machine - Electricity
Sarah: **"**Soulwax-esque and exquisite. Love the energy here, a future classic. Their new album, [Electricity](https://ibibiosoundmachine.bandcamp.com/album/electricity-2), is due to be released in March, don't miss it!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Alway happy to be with you every Sunday morning. Much love to [Alligator](https://almost-discos.bandcamp.com/album/torrents) for their vibrant and joyful Sunday selections, and many thanks to Julie Wojtczak for this episode's gorgeous illustration!</p>
