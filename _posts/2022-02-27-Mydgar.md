<p id="introduction">This morning, we stop reading the news and start dancing. Did you know the oldest proof of dancing comes from 9000 years old cave paintings that were found in India? Also, we're not the only one dancing on this planet, it's a behaviour we actually share with many other species. Music is a universal language, and in this episode co-curated with [Alligator](https://almost-discos.bandcamp.com/album/torrents), we're telling a story of joy, adventure, courage, beauty and hope.

# Mydgar's selection

## Rival Consoles - Recovery
Mydgar: **"**There is absolutely all the things I love in this track. Sometimes, when you produce music, you tend to add new elements to fill a lack of something instead of pushing one element and make it interesting. For me, in this track, Rival Consoles perfectly manages to sublimate the main lead with a super creative use and treats of it. It result a kind of minimalist track with the main lead as a guideline, I love it !**"**

## Melawati - Daliah
Mydgar: **"**This track is epic and full of story, it brings a lot of images to my mind…that's exactly what i'm looking for when listening to or producing music, well done Melawati !**"**

## Against All Logic - Fantasy
Mydgar: **"**I really like this side project of Nicolas Jaar. It might sound a little harder to listen to but the more I listen to it the more I discover things in this track…it’s like a movie you need to see twice of more! The way he uses saturation and sampling in this track is completely unbelievable !**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Mydgar - Euphoria
Sarah : **"**Sounds like spring is already here. Birds are chirping and primula flowers are starting to blossom. Instantly fell in love with this track from their newly released album, [Torrents](https://almost-discos.bandcamp.com/album/torrents), on La Souterraine. As I listen to this track, I imagine myself riding a bike along the canal, a sunny atmosphere in the air, early in the morning. A speaker, attached to the handlebar, streams the flow of music... happy waves flying around. The world is smiling.**"**

## Kadhja Bonet - For You (Many Selves Version)
Sarah: **"**Kadhja keeps pushing her art and never disappoint. Smells like a new album is coming this year. You can count on me, "I'll be there for you".**"**

## Jacques - Partout
Sarah: **"**Perfectly balanced track coming from his recently released album, [LIMPORTANCEDUVIDE](https://jacques.bandcamp.com/album/limportanceduvide). I like how he plays with his flow in this one, adventurous and curious he mixes different genres while managing to keep harmony all along. The feeling in this track reminds me of [Paradis](https://www.mailta.pe/172/paradis/), a band I miss very much..**"**

## Ibibio Sound Machine - Electricity
Sarah: **"**Soulwax-esque and exquisite. Love the energy here, a future classic. Their new album, [Electricity](https://ibibiosoundmachine.bandcamp.com/album/electricity-2), is due to be released in March, don't miss it!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Alway happy to be with you every Sunday morning. Much love to [Alligator](https://almost-discos.bandcamp.com/album/torrents) for their vibrant and joyful Sunday selections, and many thanks to Julie Wojtczak for this episode's gorgeous illustration!</p>
