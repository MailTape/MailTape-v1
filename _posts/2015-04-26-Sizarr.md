# Sizarr’s morning inspiration
 
## Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland - 2
_Fabian from Sizarr:_ **"**This is a beautiful song. It is a cover from the original "Donnie & Joe Emerson - Baby" from their album "Dreamin’ Wild". The story behind this album is pretty incredible and I think they are currently making a documentary about it. if you don’t know about it you should look it up! Anyways there have been several cover versions of this song already also by Ariel Pink, but I like this one the most.**"**
 
## Julian Lynch - Gloves
_Philipp from Sizarr:_ **"**A song from Julian Lynch's 'Lines' album. I really like the live sound of the whole album, and especially all those guitars and clarinets. But on this song, it's the bassline that got me.**"**
 
## Giant Claw - Dark Web 005
_Marc from Sizarr:_ **"**Dark Web was my favourite album of last year. I love it so much that I actually have 2 copies of it. This song might be my favourite at the moment, but that's changing all the time. Do yourself a favour and listen to the entire album, it's a real treat!**"**
