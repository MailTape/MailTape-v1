<p id="introduction">This morning, get prepared to enjoy the complexity of a MailTape pulsating with genuine bits of eclectic flavors. Together with [Sizarr](https://www.facebook.com/SizarrOfficial "Sizarr's FaceBook"), one of my favorite pick of this year so far, we bring you a stunnishing cocktail of elevating tunes combining great oldies, delirious experimentations and euphoric sequences. Actually, today’s playlist is like a box of chocolate, you won’t know the flavor till you give in to the temptation.</p>
 
# The sobs of snobs
 
[Sizarr](https://www.facebook.com/SizarrOfficial "Sizarr's FaceBook") is a pop music trio from the quiet town of Landau in Germany. Their music? An intriguing combination of positive vibes and melancholia. The dedication to excellence that transcends their music confirms their self-proclame identity of music snobs. They have worked for more than two years in the making of their sophomore album during which - they say - each song went through a long process of incremental dissecting till ultimate satisfaction was reached. The result is  “Nuture”, available on [iTunes](www.smarturl.it/NurtureiTunes) and [Amazon](http://smarturl.it/NurtureAmazon). You can now judge for yourself the worthiness of the torture that is excellence.
 
# Sizarr’s morning inspiration
 
## Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland - 2
_Fabian from Sizarr:_ **"**This is a beautiful song. It is a cover from the original "Donnie & Joe Emerson - Baby" from their album "Dreamin’ Wild". The story behind this album is pretty incredible and I think they are currently making a documentary about it. if you don’t know about it you should look it up! Anyways there have been several cover versions of this song already also by Ariel Pink, but I like this one the most.**"**
 
## Julian Lynch - Gloves
_Philipp from Sizarr:_ **"**A song from Julian Lynch's 'Lines' album. I really like the live sound of the whole album, and especially all those guitars and clarinets. But on this song, it's the bassline that got me.**"**
 
## Giant Claw - Dark Web 005
_Marc from Sizarr:_ **"**Dark Web was my favourite album of last year. I love it so much that I actually have 2 copies of it. This song might be my favourite at the moment, but that's changing all the time. Do yourself a favour and listen to the entire album, it's a real treat!**"**
