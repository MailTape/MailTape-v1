<p id="introduction">This wonderfully bright morning we are thrilled to welcome Brooklyn-based beatsmith, [jitwam.](https://www.facebook.com/jitwam/), to MailTape. His languid and soulful selections slowly evaporate the dew and drag the melodies out into the light.</p>
<p>On his full-length debut, [ज़ितम सिहँ](https://cosmic-compositions.bandcamp.com/album/--2), Jitwam. deconstructs samples of folk and jazz guitar as they buzz and hiss alongside the warm reverie of vinyl drum samples.</p>


# Collocutor's selection


## Khyam Allami - Tawazon I: Balance خيّام اللامي - توازن
_Tamar Osborn_: **"**I’m not very good at mornings so this track is one for easing into the day, starting gently and building in energy as it goes. I can’t remember exactly how I came across Khyam Allami, but it was probably while searching for oud artists after listening to Le Trio Joubran and visiting Damascus back in late 2010. I love the timbre of the instrument, and the micro-tonal inflections in his playing - this solo track really allows you to immerse yourself in it. And the idea of ‘Balance’ seems like a good place to start the day from...**"**

## Aditya Prakash Ensemble – Untruth to Truth
_Tamar Osborn_: **"**Aditya is one of my bandmates in the choreographer/dancer Akram Khan’s current production ‘Xenos’. He comes from the South Indian classical (Carnatic) tradition, but has a wide range of influences and explores the paths between them in his own projects, something which resonates with me as a composer. He has a great voice, and for me this track brings together different traditions naturally and with ease.**"**

## Hermeto Pascoal & Grupo Vice Versa - Dança Do Paje 
_Tamar Osborn_: **"**Hermeto Pascoal is one of those legendary musicians whose reputation I know well but whose music I haven’t properly explored, so I jumped on this when it was released. It spoke immediately to my ongoing love of the late 60s and 70s, not just the music but the production aesthetic of the time. Atmospherically it takes me back to when a friend took me to see a beautiful gig by the artist Joyce at the Jazz Cafe years ago, and to when I was playing in a band whose repertoire included Brazilian funk & soul by bands like Banda Black Rio, experiences which lead to me delving in to the sonic world of 60s & 70s Brazilian music. The opening section of this track is like the sun coming up, and the groove that kicks in is life affirming - complete with what sounds like a bass flute solo, not something you hear very often!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## jitwam. – alone
_Sanjay_: **"**There's a simmering storm beneath the acoustic strums of this track, coerced by generous helpings of reverb and musings on isolation.**"**

## Henry Wu – Shahada
_Sanjay_: **"**[Henry Wu](http://www.smarturl.it/kw-thereturn) and [Kieron Ifill](http://blog.nutriot.com/tag/kieron-ifill) combine to provide a two-step bedrock for delicate strings to glide over, sitting alongside an infectious and restless b-line with just enough groove for a Sunday morning.**"**

## Nabihah Iqbal – Eden Piece
_Sanjay_: **"**Lull yourself into a hazy dream this morning with [Nabihah Iqbal](https://nabihahiqbal.bandcamp.com/)'s pared-back track, Eden Piece. All wandering and lilting piano lines, booming kicks and breathy vocals.**"**

## Yves Tumor – The Feeling When You Walk Away
_Sanjay_: **"**From a cavernous looping riff reveals [Yves Tumor](https://soundcloud.com/yvestumor/)’s voice, an anguished falsetto steeped in phantasmal echoes that sounds as if it’s simultaneously vanishing just as it’s appearing.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Jitwam.](https://www.facebook.com/jitwam/) for being our guest today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
