<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome [Fran and Flora](https://www.franandflora.com/), the London-based string duo of Francesca Ter-Berg and Flora Curzon, to select some Sunday morning tunes with us on MailTape.
<br><br>
Well known in London's experimental folk and jazz scenes, Fran and Flora acknowledge a wide range of musical influences, from Bach to Alice Coltrane by way of Shostakovitch.
<br><br>
Their debut album, [Unfurl](https://www.franandflora.com/unfurl.html), was released earlier this year and they will be [on tour](https://www.franandflora.com/live.html) throughout the UK until mid-December.
</p>

# Fran & Flora's selection

## Hejira – Joyful Mind
_Fran & Flora_: **"**This mantra-like tune reconnects me with the knowledge that it's the journey which is important not the destination; that it is how we conduct ourselves in each moment that counts, and not necessarily our goals. This song reminds me how we can actually create joy, and of the importance of looking after our mental health. But it's not just the message of the song that lifts and strengthens me, the whole spirit of the song fills me with happiness, and make my body and soul dance!**"**

## JS Bach – Sarabande for solo cello in D major from Suite no.6 BWV 1012 (Mike Block)
_Fran & Flora_: **"**This track is meditative, introverted, emotional, enigmatic, contemplative and fiendishly hard to play. The trick is to make it sound easy. The rhythm is in a lilting 3/4 with an emphasis on the 2nd beat. Apparently the rhythm comes from a Moorish women's dance, but it has its roots in many sources. The chord progression is like that of a modern singer-songwriter ballad, but it was written in the early 1700’s. Everyone knows Bach invented the modern notion of Western harmony in all its wonders and complexities. I like to listen to this piece as it takes me on a different journey every time. Mike Block is an amazing cellist and teacher from Boston, MA. His CD 'Echos of Bach’ is full of stunning solo performances but this is my favourite.**"**

## Abdul Wadud – Camille
_Fran & Flora_: **"**Why do I like this? Well, no one plays like Abdul - he could improvise like no-one else and plays the shit out of the Cello. Abdul was mostly performing with different jazz outfits and solo in Chicago in the 80’s. He was doing things with the cello no-one else got close to. His style encompasses so many different influences and instruments which you can hear in his improvisations. Every time I listen to this album I hear something different, and it always makes me laugh because his playing is so cheeky and goes wherever it wants to go. No expectations or prerequisites. The heart of improvisation!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Fran & Flora – Jurjuna For Leyli
_Sanjay_: **"**I first heard Shida Shahabi's music when previous MailTape guest, [Adrian of Glockenspiel](https://www.mailta.pe/342/glockenspiel/), chose one of her tracks in his selection. This track was the first I heard after that episode and it perfectly symbolises for me the sparse and intimate sonic explorations of her music. It has an intricate pattern looped and gently built upon with no sense of rush or obligation.**"**

## William Parker – For Don Cherry
_Sanjay_: **"**A label mate of our guest this morning, [Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch](http://emilielf.com/) elegantly weaves various nuances and textures, from classical to electronica, through her material. Like Shida, Emilie rarely relies on frills and tassels and the spacey, moody, pitch of this track exhibits her deft ability with cinematic sweeps of sound.**"**

## Missy Mazzoli – Vespers for Violin
_Sanjay_: **"**Dreamy synths introduce 'Tulsi', a traditional herb of Ayurveda and Siddha medicine that is also used in the worship of Hindu gods Vishnu, Krishna, and Rama. Paired with swooning strings, the presence of arpeggiated sequences raise a vibrating wall of hallucinatory sound at the end of this track. A fine album from [Jatinder Singh Durhailay & David Edren](https://www.bonjoursupermarket.com/product/tape-tea-notes-jatinder-singh-durhailay-david-edren), who musically limn the effect of various teas through a mix of South Asian classical music and new age electronics.**"**

## Soumik Datta – Jangal
_Sanjay_: **"**Taking [Vanessa Wagner](https://vanessawagner.net/)’s originals from the 50th InFiné release, [Inland](https://soundcloud.com/infine-music/sets/vanessa-wagner-inland-versions), this is the GAS (aka [Wolfgang Voigt](https://soundcloud.com/wolfgang_voigt)) rework for Vanessa´s piano solo interpretation of [Wim Mertens](https://www.wimmertens.be/)'s 'Struggle for Pleasure'. A suitably introspective stroll for a Sunday morning...**"**
