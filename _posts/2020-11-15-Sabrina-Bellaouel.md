# Sabrina Bellaouel's selection

## Jill Scott - Show Me
Sabrina Bellaouel: **"**A dose of my favorite singer. No one writes about love like she does. Here she speaks about confidence. I would have liked to write this song:<br>
<i>"You show me your exterior, I need<br>
To see your interior, I need<br>
To be absolutely clear wit cha</i>**"**

## Steve Reich - Electric Counterpoint III. Fast
Sabrina Bellaouel: **"**Pat Metheny playing the guitar is divine. Perfect for having a shower, doing your make-up, getting dressed and taking the metro. I feel like I'm part of a whole when I listen to it.**"**

## Alfonzo Hunter - Just The Way (Remix)
Sabrina Bellaouel: **"**It's my older sister's favorite song. I bonded to this song as a teenager. She reminds me of Wednesday afternoons with my older sisters and their friends at the municipal swimming pool and also the evenings when they brought me to the Main Jaune.**"**
