<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome multilingual singer, songwriter and musician, [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch). With songs in Swiss German, English, Jamaican Patois, Spanish and French, he represents a culture of co-existence without boundaries based on language, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>While his music has its origins in roots reggae, he has recently complemented it with dub, bossa nova, rap and blues elements. His latest remix album, [Dub Ripe Fruit](https://soundcloud.com/ariwasounds/sets/dub-ripe-fruits-elijah-rajing-fyah-joe-ariwa), is a collaboration with the Jamaican band [Raging Fyah](http://ragingfyah.com/) and [Joe Ariwa](http://ariwa.com/), the son of dub and reggae legend Mad Professor.</p>


# Elijah Salomon's selection


## Dennis Brown – Have You Ever
_Elijah Salomon_: **"**Dennis Brown is one of my favourite artists of all time and just yesterday I woke up with this song. Perfect music to set the vibe for a chilled Sunday.**"**

## Burning Spear – Mi Gi Dem
_Elijah Salomon_: **"**Burning Spear always gives you an upfull energy—this is one of his many anthems to get up and live!**"**

## Damian Marley ft. Stephen Marley – Medication
_Elijah Salomon_: **"**The vibe right now is time to meditate. Hit song from Damian Marley's new album 'Stony Hill'. Takes you high.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Elijah Salomon – Power to the Dub
_Sanjay_: **"**Not only impressive in its musical diversity, [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch)'s album is more than just a series of Roots songs—it's a call to slow down, to exhale and let things run their course and mature into their natural destiny!**"**

## Aba-Shanti-I – Tower of Babel
_Sanjay_: **"**Aba-Shanti-I, former MC for Jah Tubby's Sound System, is part of the Aba-Shanti Sound System, one of London's leading roots and dub systems. This is wonderfully meditative with a  weighty bass throughout.**"**

## Mo' Kalamity – Darling
_Sanjay_: **"**Based in Paris, Mónica Tavares's (Mo' Kalamity) voice is cool and laid-back, riding atop glossy, elegant yet fiery rhythms by her band, The Wizards.**"**

## Kabaka Pyramid – No Capitalist
_Sanjay_: **"**Keron's reputation for blending the lyricism of hip-hop with the energy and melody of reggae and dancehall is on full display here: a scathing commentary on the decisions made by Jamaican politicians and neoliberal corporations at the expense of the island’s residents.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it! Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch/) for being our guest today, and to [William Girault](http://williamgirault.com/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
