# OH MU's selection

## EleaBraaz - Lobotomie
_OH MU_: **"**I found this track by accident, and I found it super atypical, it gave me a lot of energy in the morning for months.**"**

## Fishbach - Night Bird (Petit Monstre)
_OH MU_: **"**It is because it is the first track/cover I have discovered from her 3 years ago, and I used to listen to it on repeat. At that time, I wished her career would take off, which happened 2 years later.**"**

## Wit. - INDIGOCHILD
_OH MU_: **"**I love his rap and futuristic prods, and the fact that he talks about science fiction and reincarnation in his lyrics.**"** 


# MailTape's selection

## OH MU - La Nuit en Matin 
_Inès_: **"**I am so happy to have OH MU as a guest this morning. When I started listening to OH MU's music, I also dove right into their illustrations at the same moment, reading their blogs and comics and connected with some of the content. It feels that they acquired so much strength between each EP, and I love how angry the [most recent one](https://ohmu.bandcamp.com/album/oh-mu) is, especially this song, which is why I have chosen it. OH MU's music makes me feel strong. And reminds me that there is strength in vulnerability.**"**

## [Simo Soo](https://www.facebook.com/simosoo/) - Klaus 
_Inès_: **"**This one has been sitting for a while in my music! I did not think I would be ever part of an episode but here we go. I think it carries the same energy as Wit.'s track: acid, fast, angry-ish, futuristic. Super hyper track to start the morning at full speed.**"**

## [Claude Violante](https://www.facebook.com/ClaudeViolante/) - Like That
_Inès_: **"**A banger. Super efficient from the start. Swaying rythm, kind of a summery vibe to bring some warmth to this morning.**"**

## [OMMA](https://www.facebook.com/ommamoscow/) - Squid
_Inès_: **"**Okay so same vibe here. A warm-and-cold, hypnotic track. Almost tropical. Also catches you right away. A bit more chill to rest a little while, because Sundays are also made to relax, my friends.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Thank you so much for listening. Lots of love to [OH MU](https://www.facebook.com/ohmuuuu/) for their Sunday selection, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's super nice illustration!</p>
