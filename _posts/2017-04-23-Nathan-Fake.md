<p id="introduction">This morning, Nathan Fakes, who's known for his innovative and smoothly provocative work in electronic music, is our guide. Embark on a trip towards clarity and peace of mind, two things well needed... especially today in France.</p>

# Designed for relaxation and inspiration
Nathan's selection is subtle and smooth like the carress of the wind which comes and make the leaves in the forest gently dancing under the sun of Spring.
