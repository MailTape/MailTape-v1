<p id="introduction">This morning let's welcome [Nathan Fake](http://www.nathanfake.com/). He just released a new album with our dear folks from [Ninja Tune](https://ninjatune.net). Known for his innovative and smoothly provocative work in electronic music, be prepared to embark on a mesmerizing trip towards clarity and peace of mind, two things well needed... especially today in France.</p>

# Designed for relaxation and inspiration
Nathan's selection is subtle and smooth like the carress of the wind which comes and make the leaves in the forest gently dance under the sun of Spring. It demanded a few hours digging among hundreds of tracks to decide which ones could complete such humble beginnings.

Enters Kendrick Lamar and his "Damn" album just released a few days ago, unavoidable and extremely great... it was hard to resist the temptation! But it is not our mission here, Kendrick doesn't need MailTape to be known anyway.

We're here to push boundaries, to break walls and find the very rare music gems which we humbly believe constitute something totally new. A music discovery which has this particular capacity of being truly inspiring, and that demanding in the first place to be unknown. Of course music is very personal. Sometimes we hit, and sometimes we're out, but isn't it what Life is about? In the end, it's about doing our very own best, being 100% sincere and the rest will take care of itself. Peace.

# **Nathan Fake's Selection**

## HOME - Resonance
_Nathan Fake_: **"**This track is like audio valium, especially when heard on a Sunday morning.**"** (By the way, HOME was featured on [MailTape #213](https://mailta.pe/213/home/))

## Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith - When I Try I'm Full
_Nathan Fake_: **"**My favourite track off kaitlyn's "ears" lp. beautiful bubbly synths and voices.**"**

## Aphex Twin - xtal
_Nathan Fake_: **"**A bit obvious but a total fave of mine, one of the warmest and most gorgeous pieces of music ever made, I love listening to this kind of stuff all day on Sundays.**"**


# MailTape's Selection

## Nathan Fake - unen
_ImaCrea_: **"**I wanted to find a track in his new album which sounded radical to me. A sound which doesn't represent what Nathan has already done. Also I was looking for one which could hold to the same standards as the legendary xtal by Aphex Twin. Here it is.**"**

## Charlotte Adigéry - Le Froid
_ImaCrea_: **"**Surprise of the week, instant crush. Supported by the dear Dewaele brothers, also known as 2ManyDjs/Soulwax, prepare to hear a lot about Charlotte. I recommend her debut EP.**"**

## Clark - Aftermath
_ImaCrea_: **"**Definition of "aftermath": "A consequence, especially of a disaster or misfortune: famine as an aftermath of drought."**"**

## William Basinski - For David Robert Jones
_ImaCrea_: **"**20 minutes. Yes it wasn't an easy choice but radicality is in the DNA of this issue. So let's not think too straight and feel a new soundsation.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today, love you folks! Thanks to [Nathan Fake](http://www.nathanfake.com/) for his beautiful contribution and a big kiss to our great patrons for their support. Have a good trip, and don't forget to vote if you're French!</p>
