<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome LA-based singer, songwriter and guitarist [Zoya](http://www.zoyamusicofficial.com/) as she picks three uplifting and pop-filled Sunday morning jams.
<br><br>
With three albums to her name, she has gained recognition in independent pop circles as well as from heavyweights A.R. Rahman and The Chainsmokers while touring on festival bills and as a support act for the likes of Kawehi, Natty, Lucy Rose, Madame Gandhi, Youngr, Submotion Orchestra, Bloc Party, Clean Bandit, and Martin Garrix.</p>


# Zoya's selection

## King Princess – Holy
_Zoya_: **"**Love this tune and the production. [King Princess](https://kingprincessmusic.com/) always gets me in a good romantic mood. Love starting the day with romance in my brain.**"**

## [Noah Kahan](http://noahkahan.com/) – Young Blood
_Zoya_: **"**This is one of my favorite driving songs. I've been bumping it lately first thing in the morning when I go on my coffee run. Try your Sunday morning with this one. Super nostalgic vibe.**"**

## [Marc E. Bassy](http://www.marcebassy.com/) – Morning
_Zoya_: **"**Ah, I love this tune right now. I really want to make baby-making music like this one day! (haha*) Love the keys, synths and organs. This one put's me in a such a happy mood. Vibeyyyyy. Straight vibes.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Zoya – Keep You Mine
_Sanjay_: **"**I really enjoy listening to Utsav's renditions of ragas on the piano. Particularly the ways in which he has discovered methods to approximate South Asian embellishments such as the 'meend' (glissando) and the 'shrutis' (microtones). This is a version of raga Puriya—a raga, he says, that he has explored a lot recently.**"**

## Rvdical The Kid – Hawaii (with amaarae & EDWVN)
_Sanjay_: **"**As well as a painter and illustrator, [Jatinder Singh Durhailay](http://jatindersinghdurhailay.com/) is also trained in South Asian classical music, performing and practicing Kirtan as well as playing, among others, the rare instruments Dilruba and Taus.**"**

## mobilegirl – Forest Coloss
_Sanjay_: **"**A soothing solo piano rendition of Jerome Kern's 1933 song 'Yesterdays' by [Eve Risser](https://www.everisser.com/), with Boris Darley on sound. The original, with lyrics by Otto Harbach, was originally written for 'Roberta', a musical based on the novel 'Gowns by Roberta' by Alice Duer Miller.**"**

## Oumou Sangaré – Djoukourou (Auntie Flo Remix)
_Sanjay_: **"**A serial award-winner, pianist and composer [Myra Melford](http://www.myramelford.com/) opens this track with a jaunty demeanour, but it grows increasingly agitated with flurries of notes. Not unlike many of her contributions to some other projects, the melody is to be discovered in fractured glimpses seen between rhythmic lines.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Zoya](http://www.zoyamusicofficial.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
