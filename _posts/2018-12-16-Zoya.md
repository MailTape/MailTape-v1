<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome LA-based singer, songwriter and guitarist [Zoya](http://www.zoyamusicofficial.com/) as she picks three uplifting and pop-filled Sunday morning jams.
<br><br>
With three albums to her name, she has gained recognition in independent pop circles as well as from heavyweights A.R. Rahman and The Chainsmokers while touring on festival bills and as a support act for the likes of Kawehi, Natty, Lucy Rose, Madame Gandhi, Youngr, Submotion Orchestra, Bloc Party, Clean Bandit, and Martin Garrix.</p>


# Zoya's selection

## King Princess – Holy
_Zoya_: **"**Love this tune and the production. [King Princess](https://kingprincessmusic.com/) always gets me in a good romantic mood. Love starting the day with romance in my brain.**"**

## [Noah Kahan](http://noahkahan.com/) – Young Blood
_Zoya_: **"**This is one of my favorite driving songs. I've been bumping it lately first thing in the morning when I go on my coffee run. Try your Sunday morning with this one. Super nostalgic vibe.**"**

## [Marc E. Bassy](http://www.marcebassy.com/) – Morning
_Zoya_: **"**Ah, I love this tune right now. I really want to make baby-making music like this one day! (haha*) Love the keys, synths and organs. This one put's me in a such a happy mood. Vibeyyyyy. Straight vibes.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Zoya – Keep You Mine
_Sanjay_: **"**Released just last Friday, this latest track from Zoya plays a tasteful balancing act—blending elements of American dance music and catchy lyrics with vocal melodies rooted by Indian pop music.**"**

## Rvdical The Kid – Hawaii (with amaarae & EDWVN)
_Sanjay_: **"**At just under two minutes long this track from [Rvdical the Kid](https://soundcloud.com/rvdicalthekid/) featuring [amaarae](http://amaaraemusic.com/), with additional vocals by [EDWVN](https://soundcloud.com/edwvn), carries a dreamy and whispery vibe. The beat and her singing rise contemporaneously, her voice sliding along the rising soundscape of the song.**"**

## mobilegirl – Forest Coloss
_Sanjay_: **"**Beautiful and subdued, yet sharp as a tack. Taken from Berlin-based [mobilegirl](https://soundcloud.com/mobilegirl)'s (a.k.a. Bao-Tran Tran) first official release, 'Poise'. An EP of lilting strings, elegant arrangements and placid drums.**"**

## Oumou Sangaré – Djoukourou (Auntie Flo Remix)
_Sanjay_: **"**Beginning and ending with fluttering xylophone sounds swaying back and forth between two tones, [Auntie Flo](https://soundcloud.com/auntie-flo/)'s remix transforms [Oumou Sangaré](https://www.instagram.com/oumou.sang/)’s original—adorned with Wassoulou instruments—into a percussion-rich, dancefloor-centric reimagination.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Zoya](http://www.zoyamusicofficial.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
