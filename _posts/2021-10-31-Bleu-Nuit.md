# Bleu Nuit's selection

## Family Fodder - Savoir Faire 
Bleu Nuit: **"**I instantly fell in love with this song that is bursting with energy. This 7 inch that I won during an eBay online auction mixes French and English under a synth-punk soundtrack straight out of 1980. Simply genius.**"**

## Virna Lindt - The Dossier On Virna Lindt 
Bleu Nuit: **"**I walk into a record store and hear this piece which plunges me into a world that is both James Bondesque and languid. Of an icy beauty, the entirety of this album is sublime. It's like walking on clouds while tasting marshmallows for the first time. Get it?**"**

## Tuxedomoon - Midnite Stroll
Bleu Nuit: **"**I was obsessed with this EP released in 1979 for several days. I chose the song Midnite Stroll for its cinematic and avant-garde approach. Let yourself be enveloped by strange saxophones and the humid atmosphere of this little-known title. Perfect timing for Halloween.**"**
