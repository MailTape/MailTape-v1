<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Bex Burch of London-based trio [Vula Viel](https://vulaviel.com/) to select three funky Sunday morning tunes for us.
<br><br>
Vula Viel means ‘Good is Good’ in Dagaare—the maternal language of Ghana's Dagaaba people where founding member Bex Burch lived, farmed and studied for three years. Alongside Ruth Goller and Jim Hart, as well as other collaborators, Vula Viel create a joyously rhythmic sense of stark—but enormously imaginative—minimalism based around the 'Gyil' (the Dagaare xylophone made of sacred lliga wood).<br><br>
Vula Viel will be [on tour](https://vulaviel.com/gigs/) throughout the UK for most of spring.</p>


# Julia Biel's selection

## Zakir Hussain – Zakir
_Julia Biel_: **"**This has been a cherished tune for me for a couple of decades now. There's something so incredibly fresh about it, it never fails to revitalise me and replenish my energy stores. It's so open and questioning in spirit but also coming from a place of acceptance, just 
perfect to relax and unwind to.**"**

## Joni Mitchell – Morning Morgantown
_Julia Biel_: **"**I only discovered this particular album of Joni's a couple of years ago. I put it on in the record shop and fell in love with the first song 'Morning Morgantown' within about 20 seconds. The warmth of it wraps around me and is immediately comforting and shielding. Joni's voice is at her most incredible on this album, so pure and effortless how it floats off into her high register, it's mesmerising and the song-writing falls right into that sweet spot between complex and accessible.**"**

## We Were Strangers – Unforgiving War
_Julia Biel_: **"**I stumbled upon this little known gem right before Christmas. So emotive in its delivery, I'm hooked in from the off every time I listen to it and the visual imagery and beautiful subtle build in the production keeps me enthralled to the end. Love it.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Julia Biel – Dead Slept Rough
_Sanjay_: **"**Like most of Vula Viel's latest album, this title track confidently weaves sparse polyrhythms and intricate rhythm structures around Bex Burch’s Gyil lines. Eventually developing into a euphoric end, it urges the listener not to fear what they believe, hope and love.**"**

## Laura Nyro – Upstairs by a Chinese Lamp
_Sanjay_: **"**This album's liner notes state that 'Semillero is music that moves souls, allows imaginations to flourish and the feet to follow'. Meaning both seed and incubator, this title track is indeed such a gem—combining Andean flutes, electronica and Afro-Peruvian music. [Dengue Dengue Dengue](https://denguedenguedengue.net/) tell the story of Andean migration to the coast of Peru, where African influence continues to evolve.**"**

## Marian Anderson – Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child
_Sanjay_: **"**For the better part of three decades [Hailu Mergia](https://hailumergia.bandcamp.com/) drove a taxi in Washington DC, writing new music in his cab between shifts and recording a few homemade cassettes featuring himself on accordion, Rhodes piano, Yamaha DX7 and drum machine. The result is hypnotic and melodica-led pentatonic rhythms mingling with American bop.This one is remastered by [Awesome Tapes from Africa](https://www.awesometapes.com/).**"**

## Keyvan Chemirani & Pandit Anindo Chatterjee – Bhairavi
_Sanjay_: **"**[Rosie Turton](https://soundcloud.com/rosieturton) really lets fly with the trombone on this interpretation of a Herbie Hancock original. Alongside [Johanna Burnheart](https://www.johannaburnheart.com/) on violin, [Maria Chiara Argirò](http://mariachiaramusic.com/) on piano/wurlitzer, [Twm Dylan](https://soundcloud.com/twmdylan) on bass, and [Jake Long](https://twitter.com/jakelongdrums) on drums, they strip out the electro-funk elements of the original and beautifully distill it down to a smoother-grooving vibe.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening. Much respect to [Bex Burch of Vula Viel](https://vulaviel.com/) for her Sunday selections today, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
