## Matthewdavid's Mindflight - Orange Ganesh

## Ramayana Soul - Jaya Raga Jiwa MiraNgga Bhineka Tunggal Ika
_Kotsu Guy_: **"**I like tropical feeling in this song. They are good musicians from Indonesia. Their album was released from our label, Guruguru Brain.**"**

_Kotsu Guy_: **"**Endless epic jam for Sunday morning. Recently I found this band. This is favourite track in their songs.**"**
