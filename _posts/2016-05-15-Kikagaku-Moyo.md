<p id="introduction">This morning, enjoy a walk through the mind with a psyche selection by our guest of the week, [Kikagaku Moyo](https://www.facebook.com/kikagakumoyo/?fref=ts). It's time to stop and think. </p>

# 



 
# Kikagaku Moyo's selection:

## Matthewdavid's Mindflight - Orange Ganesh
_Kotsuguy_: **"**I often listen to this ambient/new age side album. It's good for meditation
or astral projection. If I wake up too early on sunday morning, I'll go back to sleep and play this kind of music.**"**

## Ramayana Soul - Jaya Raga Jiwa MiraNgga Bhineka Tunggal Ika
_Kotsuguy_: **"**I like tropical feeling in this song. They are good musicians from Indonesia. Their album was released from our label, Guruguru Brain.**"**

## Chris Forsyth & The Solar Motel Band - The Ballad Of Freer Hollow
_Kotsuguy_: **"**Endless epic jam for Sunday morning. Recently I found this band. This is favourite track in their songs.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! </p>
