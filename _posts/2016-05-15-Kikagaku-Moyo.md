<p id="introduction">This sunday, it’s time to relive some of our memories from the past as well as to create a handful for the future. Our pick of the week, [Fishbach](https://fishbach.bandcamp.com/releases), is all set to do so by engaging you in a playlist that will instantly liven you up.</p>

# Ageless sounds...

It’s almost impossible to resist the pull with which “Mortel” by Fishbach drags you to the era of the 80s or so it seems. The melancholy in it speaks for itself and is easily identifiable; the coldness, however, sets a specific tone that seems to stir a cluster of emotions… Overall, Fishbach flawlessly seems to uphold and deliver the promise of a young budding artist with ageless sounds.   
 
# Kikagaku Moyo's selection:

## Matthewdavid's Mindflight - Orange Ganesh
_Kotsuguy_: **"**I often listen to this ambient/new age side album. It's good for meditation
or astral projection. If I wake up too early on sunday morning, I'll go back to sleep and play this kind of music.**"**

## Ramayana Soul - Jaya Raga Jiwa MiraNgga Bhineka Tunggal Ika
_Kotsuguy_: **"**I like tropical feeling in this song. They are good musicians from Indonesia. Their album was released from our label, Guruguru Brain.**"**

## Chris Forsyth & The Solar Motel Band - The Ballad Of Freer Hollow
_Kotsuguy_: **"**Endless epic jam for Sunday morning. Recently I found this band. This is favourite track in their songs.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! </p>
