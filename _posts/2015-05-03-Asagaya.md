<p id="introduction">This morning, enjoy a freshly baked episode with the help of our special guest [Asagaya](https://www.facebook.com/asa6aya). Follow the recipe for a stunning Sunday : a pinch of dreamy mood, a cup of vibrant and some bliss and rough tracks. There is your energy drink for today.</p>
 
# Hip-hop master

Who's Asagaya? It's a mystery. The Japanese beatmaker wears a mask all the time and doesn't give much information about himself. The main thing is to focus on the music and his album The Light of Dawn has a lot to offer. Produced by GUTS, mastered by Blanka (La Fine Équipe), featuring Jay Prince, Akua Naru and many others ; Asagaya knows how to surround himself with the good persons for sure, but this first LP is just impressive. Take a break and go listen to the brilliant beats and arrangements. 
 
# Asagaya’s morning inspiration
 
## Jay Prince - Phase
_Asagaya:_ **"**I had the privilege to work with Jay Prince on my album thanks to Guts and his never-falling intuition. Jay Prince is young, humble and talented. I really appreciate this track for its melancholic mood.**"**
 
## Tricky - Ghetto Stars
_Asagaya:_ **"**Tricky belongs those who made me want to buy my first machines, produce my own tracks and write my lyrics. 
I have followed his work since I'm a teenager until now and he keeps dazzling me.**"**
 
## The Budos Band - The Sticks
_Asagaya:_ **"**The band I always dreamned of. The soul, the power, the darkness, beers... They've got the whole package.
Their albums are really elaborate and their shows are phenomenal ; I'm a total fan.**"**
