<p id="introduction">This morning, we're extremely happy to welcome [Agar Agar](https://agar--agar.bandcamp.com/album/player-non-player) as our guests. The last time we had their music on MailTape, was 7 years ago in the selection of our [214th episode with Michelle Blades](https://www.mailta.pe/214/michelle-blades/). Today, we're honored to dive into their universe with an aerial and eclectic selection done with great care and generosity.

# Agar Agar's selection

## [Ssaliva](https://ssaliva.bandcamp.com) - Deceiver
Agar Agar: **"**This is their new project, the new EP Honeycomb. It's good to wake up in the morning perfect for a sunny Sunday. The whole EP is beautiful.**"**

## [Doss](https://doss.bandcamp.com) - Here Tonight
Agar Agar: **"**An EP from 2014 and a beautiful, sad and beautiful song. The voice whispers to you that everything is going to be okay, it's perfect when it's not, and it reassures you about the world. "It's Gonna be OK".**"**

## [Roedelius & Arnold Kasar](https://www.discogs.com/release/10477403-Hans-Joachim-Roedelius-Arnold-Kasar-Einfluss) - Rolling
Agar Agar: **"**I don't understand how they managed to record such a detailed yet imprecise piece of piano.
The resulting emotion is subtle, I like it when music gives me the space to develop my feelings, growing through the repetitions of the track.**"**

 
# MailTape's selection

## [Agar Agar](https://agar--agar.bandcamp.com/album/player-non-player) - Trouble
ImaCrea: **"**There's something innocent in this track that encompasses the vibe of their newly released second album ["Player Non Player"](https://agar--agar.bandcamp.com/album/player-non-player). I think I got addicted to it. I find that listening to it reactivates many styles from jungle, UK pop, prodigy-esque riff, and immersive keys from video game landscapes. Well-needed positive vibes in these times.**"**

## [Spivak](https://spivak.bandcamp.com) - Σχεδόν Σίγουρα (with H4S)
ImaCrea: **"**Taken from the original debut LP, ['Μετά Το Ρέιβ'](https://spivak.bandcamp.com/album/-) by Maria Spivak. A gem of perfect ambient I stumbled upon totally by chance. As it says on her Bandcamp, "lessons from ’80s post-punk to ambient-pop and trip hop inform Spivak’s music as much as her observations on Cypriot sociopolitics, culture, and nature." I couldn't say it better :)**"**

## [Lila Tirando a Violeta](https://lilatirandoavioleta.bandcamp.com) - Aguas Violentas
ImaCrea: **"**We're now going to Uruguay to discover Lila Tirando a Violeta's music. Very deep stuff here and mineral energies coming from the ground and vibrating directly to the bones. I'm honestly obsessed with this track coming from her latest album "Desire Path". Not a single day I don't listen to it since the beginning of the year. A full trip.**"**

## [Yves Tumor](https://yves-tumor.bandcamp.com) - Echolalia
ImaCrea: **"**Track newly released... Yves, Yves... I love your music so much. What else to say? Yes, something: if you read this let's make an episode together!**"**"

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! Many hugs to Clara and Armand from Agar Agar for this spatial episode. And to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for his ethereal illustration based on a picture by [Naïa Combary](https://www.naiacombary.com/acceuil).</p>
