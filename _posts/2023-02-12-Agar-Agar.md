# Agar Agar's selection

## Ssaliva - Deceiver
Agar Agar: **"**This is their new project, new EP Honeycomb. It's good to wake up in the morning perfect for a sunny Sunday. The whole EP is beautiful.**"**

## Doss - Here Tonight
Agar Agar: **"**An EP from 2014 and a beautiful, sad and beautiful song. The voice whispers to you that everything is going to be okay, it's perfect when it's not, it reassures you about the world. "It's Gonna be OK".**"**

## Roedelius & Arnold Kasar - Rolling
Agar Agar: **"**I don't understand how they managed to record such a detailed yet imprecise piece of piano.
The resulting emotion is sublte, I like it when music gives me the space to develop my own feelings, growing through the repetitions of the track.**"**
