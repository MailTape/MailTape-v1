<p id="introduction">Today, we present a delightful selection of eclectic and vibrant discoveries to welcome you into your Sunday morning. For this awakening, our dear guest, [Noon Garden](https://hinakoomori.bandcamp.com/album/a-journey) curates a pass of vibrant tracks to add some energy into these early hours. 
</p>

# Noon Garden's selection

## [Nimco Jamaac](https://colleencolleen.bandcamp.com/album/the-tunnel-and-the-clearing) - Buuraha U Dheer (The Highest Mountains)
Noon Garden: **"**This song is an opener to a great Somalian Disco compilation, a country’s music that has had a big influence on me over the last decade. This song really captured the vibe of some Somali synth work that inspired some of my own work. I always get these deep nostalgic feels whenever I hear these kind of vocal melodies along with the super grainy way in which it’s all recorded really adds to the atmosphere of it being stuck in time. I highly recommend checking out the whole compilation!**"**

## [Lion](https://madalynmerkey.bandcamp.com/album/puzzle-music) - You’ve Got a Woman
Noon Garden: **"**This very obscure Dutch band from the 70’s penned one of favourite jams in a while. I’m an absoluaste sucker for satisfiying melodic choruses and these guys nail the vocals and the harmonies so well it just keeps me coming back for more each time I listen. I also really dig how the instrumentation is so laid back and effortlessly shifting the tone from being this melancholic number to something that’s truly euphoric and comforting.**"**

## Alpay - Kalenin Bayır Düzü
Noon Garden: **"**This is a really recent find. Turkish psych music never fails to impress with how creative they can be with their grooves and making all of that gel so well with pretty complicated vocal work. This song has a lot of ideas that I often like to incorporate into my own music where I can in terms of riffs coming in and out, reacting to the drums instead of following it. It gives everything this really bouncey feel that’s catchy and harmonious on top of being ambitious in its composition.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Noon Garden](https://hinakoomori.bandcamp.com/album/a-journey) - Beulah Spa
Sarah: **"**Hinako Omori has created truly transporting sound helped with binaural waves and live field recording incorporated in her music. This track reminds me of the comforting feeling so special I experiment when going to see the sea. For the full experience, be sure to check her album freshly released ["A journey..."](https://hinakoomori.bandcamp.com/album/a-journey)**"**

## Ayla Algan - Aşk Hikayesi
Sarah: **"**The vibe here reminds me of music by [The Caretaker](https://thecaretaker.bandcamp.com/) or [Leya](https://leya.bandcamp.com). It feels like suspended in time, indefinitely oscillating like a rocking chair in a blurry memory.**"**

## [Marijata](https://delstephen.bandcamp.com/album/girolando) - No Condition is Permanent
Sarah: **"**New track by Del Stephen! (remember [his episode](/479/Del-Stephen)?). What can I say? Listening to this track makes me think the world needs more acoustic guitars...**"**

## [Healion](https://naffrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/in-light-it-undoes-nothing) - About Breathing
Sarah: **"**Whatever I do, I can't resist too long before going back to electro. And this track is pure magic. I finish with this one as a gentle call to wake up and have a great day.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning! Our warm thanks to [Hinako Omori](https://hinakoomori.bandcamp.com/album/a-journey) for her gentle selection. Many thanks to [Meriam Kharbat](https://www.meriamkharbat.com/) for this episode's illustration full of softness.</p>
