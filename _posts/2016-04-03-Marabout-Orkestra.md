<p id="introduction">This morning, we're bringing you a soulful selection made in collaboration with [Marabout Orkestra](http://maraboutorkestra.com/). Their afro jazz-funk inspiration is a sure bet to get you in a great mood and open your musical horizon.

# That warm human feeling

Jazz feels like a deeply humane music in the sense that it ask a full body approach when being played. One might have difficulties in playing jazz without being able to fully relax her thoughts and go in the flow without any compromise. One could argue that for any music genre, but the fact that jazz is mostly improvised builds, I believe, even more expectations towards that total self-giving way of playing.

In return, the music which results from it creates an intense feeling of warmth mixed with bits of charming imperfections. See, as you're reading I'd bet you're head is already noding to these soulful beats. Come on, shake that thing, it's Sunday!
 
# Marabout Orkestra's selection:

## Herbie Hancock - Wiggle Waggle (Mr Scruff Remix)

Marabout Orkestra: "It's very cool to listen a pure musical monument ! Fat Albert Rotunda is a jazz funk album base, released in 1969.
Wiggle Waggle is a very cool track, the horns are well lush and so punchy, sweet keys....and that break crisper and fatter...I wouldn't expect anything less from Scruff. And for sure Herbie is THE man !"

## K Frimpong & His Cubano Fiestas - Kyenkyen Bi Adi M'awu

MO: "Alhaji K. Frimpong recorded this masterpiece album of Ghanaian highlife in 1976. It starts off with the classic "Kyenkyen Bi Adi M'awu". Chunky grooves laid down by rolling percussion, funky guitar comp, and moody vibrato-heavy organ, all topped with beautiful melancholic vocal and horn lines."

## Geraldo Pino - Shake Hands

MO: "From Sierra Leone, this singer and guitarist was a huge influence on the West African soul/funk/afrobeat scene back in the 60s. He does one of the best James Brown imitations I've ever heard, other than the Godfather himself..."
