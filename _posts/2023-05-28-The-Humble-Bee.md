description: This morning, I'd be delighted to continue our exploration of ambient music together, as you may have noticed my recent fascination with it. Lately, I find myself yearning for a serene and inviting atmosphere, a sanctuary from the chaos of everyday life. I'm honored we invite you to join us for a serene experience featuring our guest, The Humble Bee. This episode is filled with ambient music that will transport you to a place of calm and introspection. It's not just about listening; it's about truly immersing yourself in the moment. Whether you're admiring a beautiful landscape, taking a leisurely stroll through the countryside, expressing yourself through art, or simply enjoying the pleasure of cooking a delicious meal, each track acts as a gateway to a contemplative state of mind. It's a chance to reconnect with the world around us, to appreciate our place within it, and to find moments of peace and reflection.

# The Humble Bee's selection

Sundays always seem to me to be a quiet day, calm, and less rushed or hectic than the others. I am not sure if I feel it is the end of the week, a slowing down and finding rest or the start of the week, the slow awakening maybe it is a transitional period between the two either way I like the music to be calm and unfurling, the music slow and spacious, no pressure on the ears but a space in them for you to move within.

If allowed I would always start with the live birdsong from the open kitchen window, whist drinking the first coffee. Then, I would follow these with :

## Elisabeth Klinck - River

The Humble Bee: **"**A very gentle breathing feeling to this, slow, close movements.**"**

## ROMANCE - Golden Slumbers

The Humble Bee: **"**A warm space within this track, like the first blushes of sun touching your face.**"**

## Clarice Jensen - BC

The Humble Bee: **"**Then i am ready for the day.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## The Humble Bee - Murmur

ImaCrea: "And now, I'll continue with this magnificent musical playground that our guest opens up for us, with utmost gentleness."

## Zonderwerk - Vuurfeest

ImaCrea: "The day settles in, and we're already on our way, while the architecture watches us, or perhaps it is we who watch it?"

## De Leon - A4

ImaCrea: "We enter one of the buildings randomly and climb to the rooftop. The sun caresses our skin as we lie down and let the sounds dance in the air."

## Hania Rani - Mountains

ImaCrea: "Then we rise, and suddenly the landscape changes. Concrete gives way to wild grass, and the mountains stand before us. In the distance, the desire to walk and explore the scenery."

<p id="outroduction">Thatâ€™s it for today! Thanks for being with us, life is magic. Much love to [The Humble Bee](https://thehumblebee.bandcamp.com/) for his blissful selection. And all claps out to Meriam for her funky illustration. See you next Sunday.</p>
