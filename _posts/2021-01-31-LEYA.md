## 
This morning, allow yourself to cross the threshold from the Sunday morning reality into the dream scape, constructed and maintained by our dear guest and guide, LEYA. Their latest album, Flood Dream, brings us to share the same breath, or rather to be consumed by the castles in  air of their eternal dream state, as we are swept up in the album's flood.  

The rush and power of this Flood Dream reflects a step even beyond the flourishing Duane Michals poem as we become one with LEYA's album vision: 

Ah dreams,
Those Luminous Meteors
That Light the Night Skies
Of Our Consciousness, 
Their Own Reality. 

The pleasure is ours as we welcome Brooklyn-based duo LEYA, formed by harpist and vocalist Marilu Donovan and violinist and vocalist Adam Markiewicz. Together, they have made LEYA into an other-wordly mesh and musical current of classical, ambient, metal, and experimental sound; delightfully refusing to conform to any one genre of music.

# LEYA's selection

## [dog](https://praisedog.bandcamp.com/) – to depths descend
LEYA: **"**dog is one of the best bands in NYC - close friends to us and beautiful people. They were central at The Glove (RIP) and lived under the floor of our old spot The Wallet (also RIP), like literally dug into the dirt and built a room and lived down there. REAL OGS WILL REMEMBER THE LEYA + DOG TOUR IN 2018.**"**

## [Ana Roxanne ](https://anaroxanne.bandcamp.com/album/because-of-a-flower-2) – Camille
LEYA: **"**We love this nighttime chiller - a sensuous at-home kind of feeling, maybe a good vibe for driving in the rain or making extended eye contact with someone across a room? This is a weird pick on a record so draped in minimal landscaping - it has a beat and moves in this hazy way while everything else on the EP is more deconstructed. To us it’s like a revelation that we’re all a little bit the same, playing to the austere in our days, slipping into something a little more comfortable in the dark.**"**

## [Pa Salieu](https://martelo.bandcamp.com/) – My Family ft BackRoad Gee 
LEYA: **"**A special track with such a strong connection between the two of them - seamless waves of syncopation punctuate the whole thing. We’re obviously late but this is still so under-sung.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [LEYA](https://leya.bandcamp.com/) – Em Meu Lugar
Sarah: **"**Chico wrote this song in the beginning of 2020, sitting alone with his guitar at the top one of Portugal's hotel buildings. [Em Meu Lugar](https://chicobernardes.bandcamp.com/track/em-meu-lugar-3), meaning **In My Place**, describes how all of Chico's thoughts live within him, making a world of the people he loves, of his memories, and of his experiences of emotion. This inner world is one that travels wherever he does. The song recognizes his immediate solitude but also takes comfort in the company within him. Such a beautiful sentiment, especially today. Speaking to Chico about the song's production, the track took on new significance during its recording experience. The soaring instrumentals and striking harmonies made up by the violins, trumpets, violas, and clarinets were all recorded remotely by each musician during Brazil's quarantine, patched together to form this seamless composite of sound. Wonderful :)**"**

## [Elan Noon](https://elannoon.bandcamp.com/) – Modern Blues
Sarah: **"**The first track on Elan Noon's album [Colour Story](https://elannoon.bandcamp.com/). I love the guitar riffs that roll through the periphery of this one, the melody is a bit jarring. The brass transition halfway along the track deepens the mood of the track, thoroughly establishing modern blues. A go-to track for reflecting.**"**

## [Piry Reis](https://piri.bandcamp.com/) – Chão Vermelho
Sarah: **"**This track comes from the 1970 debut album of Brazilian guitarist Piry Reis (known on this album as Piri), called "[Vocês Querem Mate?](https://piri.bandcamp.com/album/voc-s-querem-mate)”. The conversation between the flute and vocals is captivating, as is the track's dynamic tangling with melodic dissonance. This song and the entire album features Brazilian folk traditions of bossa and samba patterned with the psychedelic influences of the 1970’s in the most delightful way.**"**

## [Gábor Szabó](https://www.discogs.com/artist/22851-Gabor-Szabo) – San Franciscan Nights
Sarah: **"**Gábor Szabó's 1967 album, **Wind, Sky, and Diamonds**, collaborated with the [California Dreamers](http://www.themamasandthepapasofficial.com/) for 11 cover tracks. The album departed from Gábor Szabó's typical instrumental album release, but Gábor Szabó's emphasis on guitar melodies and soloing in each song make listening to the album tremendously engaging. First released by [The Animals](https://www.facebook.com/TheAnimalsMusic/), the cover of San Franciscan Nights featuring on this album is dynamite, especially for Szabó's soloing and guitar accents that weave around the vocals of the California Dreamers. It still has so much of the protest aspect intended in the original release, including the track's ominous set of interlude chords that starkly contrast the later lush chorus. Such a balance of sound, and a vibrant song to end the last MailTape episode of 2020.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning, and for the year! As always, thank you for taking the time to listen. It was a delight to welcome [Chico Bernardes](https://chicobernardes.bandcamp.com/) for a thoughtful and vibrant Sunday selection. Thank you to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for this episode's brilliant illustration! Happy New Year from MailTape to you :)
