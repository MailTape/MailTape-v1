## 
This morning, let yourself cross the threshold from Sunday morning realities back into the dream scape, constructed and maintained by our dear guest and guide, LEYA. Their latest album, Flood Dream, brings us to share the same breath, or rather to be consumed by their castles in air, as we are swept up in the album's flood.  

The rush and power of this Flood Dream reflects a step far beyond the flourishing Duane Michals poem: 

Ah dreams,
Those Luminous Meteors
That Light the Night Skies
Of Our Consciousness, 
Their Own Reality. 

Instead of the temporary nature of night skies, LEYA offers us eternal dream scapes in their album releases, and the pleasure is ours as we welcome the Brooklyn-based duo to bring this alternate reality to the tangible forefront. Formed by harpist and vocalist Marilu Donovan and violinist and vocalist Adam Markiewicz, LEYA consistently pushes past accepted and expected boundaries of music. Together, the artists have crafted LEYA into an other-wordly mesh and musical current of classical, ambient, metal, and experimental sound; delightfully refusing to conform to any one genre of music.

# LEYA's selection

## [dog](https://praisedog.bandcamp.com/) – to depths descend
LEYA: **"**dog is one of the best bands in NYC - close friends to us and beautiful people. They were central at The Glove (RIP) and lived under the floor of our old spot The Wallet (also RIP), like literally dug into the dirt and built a room and lived down there. REAL OGS WILL REMEMBER THE LEYA + DOG TOUR IN 2018.**"**

## [Ana Roxanne ](https://anaroxanne.bandcamp.com/album/because-of-a-flower-2) – Camille
LEYA: **"**We love this nighttime chiller - a sensuous at-home kind of feeling, maybe a good vibe for driving in the rain or making extended eye contact with someone across a room? This is a weird pick on a record so draped in minimal landscaping - it has a beat and moves in this hazy way while everything else on the EP is more deconstructed. To us it’s like a revelation that we’re all a little bit the same, playing to the austere in our days, slipping into something a little more comfortable in the dark.**"**

## [Pa Salieu](https://martelo.bandcamp.com/) – My Family ft BackRoad Gee 
LEYA: **"**A special track with such a strong connection between the two of them - seamless waves of syncopation punctuate the whole thing. We’re obviously late but this is still so under-sung.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## [LEYA](https://leya.bandcamp.com/) – INTP
Sarah: **"**Speaking about their mission with LEYA, Marilu and Adam describe feeling actively protective of their creative vision, cultivating a shared and isolated arena of courageous conversation and collaboration between the two of them. This track stands out to LEYA as the most electric composition process of their Flood Dream album. Their comfort and embrace of alternate tunings lure listeners into a new universe of jarring harp areggios and violin swells, all textured against and beside celestial vocals. Let this track surround and carry you like the flood dream of the album's namesake :)**"**

## [Eartheater](https://eartheater.bandcamp.com/), [LEYA](https://leya.bandcamp.com/) – Stronger
Sarah: **"**This track comes from LEYA's 2019 collaboration with Eartheater on their shared EP, Angel Lust. The melodic dissonace and spirals of transcendental harp and violin movements bless this track with soul-stirring momentum. The operatic stretches haunt the track with the most creative and captivating balance. With so much varied texture, you may want to listen through this one over again :)**"**

## [charlie zacks](https://elannoon.bandcamp.com/) – deadwaltz
Sarah: **"**The emotion on this song is so readily created by charlie zacks and felt by each listener. I'm obsessed with the medium blending throughout, all of the movement patched together in a connected lattice of sound; listen for the break toward the end :)**"**

## [Gábor Szabó](https://www.discogs.com/artist/22851-Gabor-Szabo) – San Franciscan Nights
Sarah: **"**Gábor Szabó's 1967 album, **Wind, Sky, and Diamonds**, collaborated with the [California Dreamers](http://www.themamasandthepapasofficial.com/) for 11 cover tracks. The album departed from Gábor Szabó's typical instrumental album release, but Gábor Szabó's emphasis on guitar melodies and soloing in each song make listening to the album tremendously engaging. First released by [The Animals](https://www.facebook.com/TheAnimalsMusic/), the cover of San Franciscan Nights featuring on this album is dynamite, especially for Szabó's soloing and guitar accents that weave around the vocals of the California Dreamers. It still has so much of the protest aspect intended in the original release, including the track's ominous set of interlude chords that starkly contrast the later lush chorus. Such a balance of sound, and a vibrant song to end the last MailTape episode of 2020.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning, but we hope you carry this dreamscape energy throughout your week :) As always, thank you for taking the time to listen. It was a joy and pleasure to welcome [LEYA](https://leya.bandcamp.com/) for this eclectic and engaging Sunday selection. A thousand thanks and bravos to [Thibault Daumain](https://www.instagram.com/thibaultdaumain/?hl=en) for this episode's stunning illustration.
