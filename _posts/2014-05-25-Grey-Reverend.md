This Morning, a warm voice will wake you up. We are very pleased to introduce you to [Grey Reverend](https://soundcloud.com/grey-reverend "Grey Reverend Soundcloud Page"). His selection perfectly reflects the emotions he brings in his own music. We hope you'll like it.</p>

# The ingredients of a modern bluesman

[Grey Reverend](http://ninjatune.net/artist/grey-reverend#.U392AZR_uBA "Grey Reverend's Page on Ninja Tune ") is a very singular artist. Signed on the label [Ninja Tune](http://ninjatune.net/ "Ninja Tune Website"), he released two albums full of smoothness and poetry. He has also done some really cool featurings like [this one](http://ninjatune.net/release/bonobo/first-fires "Bonobo Featuring Grey Reverend - First Fires") we had the chance to see live. That being said, finish your breakfast while listening to him, he'll make your sunday...

# His morning selection

## Nina Simone - I Loves You Porgy
Grey Reverend: **"**This is a great song for a rainy sunday morning! It never ceases to make me feel like there is still beauty in the world amidst all of the ugly around us…**"**

## Tom Scott - Today
Grey Reverend: **"**This version of this song is one of my favorite productions. It swings just right and I often listen to this one when I’m on the move during a sunday a.m. really gets me going…**"**

## Dusty Springfield - Just A Little loving
Grey Reverend: **"**I love this song from Live in Memphis by Dusty! The strings and her voice are so sexy and lush. it’s a great song for a **“**walk of shame**”** or just for setting the mood with a lover, or **"**potential**"** lover:)**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to [Grey Reverend](https://www.facebook.com/greyreverend "Grey Reverend Facebook") for his selection. Thanks and enjoy your sunday!
