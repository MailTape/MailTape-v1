<p id="introduction">This morning, it feels like the return of the long Sundays under the blanket watching the rain fall. The heat and sun of this summer gives way to the coolness of the morning. Depressed, but here at MailTape, we have the solution: a selection of music made by the group Laventure. Chill, relaxation and sunshine in your heart assured!
<br><br>Laventure is a Strasbourg duo composed of Ingrid Laventure and Boris Lodel. A pop-lo musical project -fi which was born last January and has been able to assert itself little by little on social networks but also through their off-the-shoot DIY clip like “Little Dog. ” We love this chill atmosphere and that’s what we’ll discover in their Sunday selection.</p>


# Laventure's selection

## Franck Zappa - Advance Romance
Laventure: **"**This choice really comes from the bottom of my heart… My dad always tells the story of how he used to listen to this CD, especially this song with the hypnotic Captain Beefheart, in the family’s car when I was just a baby sitting in the back seat.When I listen to this track, I still get the same feeling I got then… I wished above anything else in the world to be Terry Bozzio (the drummer)! My imaginary world would mix all of my dad’s anecdotes about the gigs he went to… It was spectacular, just like Frank Zappa’s career. That strange character with a sharp face, a goatee with this musketeer vibe as thick as a cigarette paper. Genius? Mad scientist? Punk? Soul man? It’s almost impossible to love all his craft but contrary to what people usually think, there’s a ZAPPA for everyone. **"**

## Q - Alone
Laventure: **"**Man this summer was hard haha. Boris and I spent almost the whole season in our bedrooms working on our next project while our friends left for the holidays… Since we had different tasks, we didn’t even see each other that much. I had to record the vocals for the tracks and Boris had to rearrange them. That was a lonely and challenging time but it was also so enriching and rewarding. It’s this kind of period in your life where you have no choice but to grow.So I used to listen to this masterpiece when I felt down. There’s something so soothing and comforting about this song. I don’t know what but it makes me feel better!**"**

## Broncho - Get in My Car 
Laventure: **"**This song makes us want to get on the road with our team again. I think it’s a love song? Haha. But the lyrics quite apply to our friendship. We wouldn’t want to make it on our own. We’ve got each other and we’ll try to go as far as possible together… Wow that was cheesy af, but sincere hahaha.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Laventure - Give
Anaïs G: **"**Being a big fan of Connan Mockasin and his band Soft Hair, I couldn’t help but love Laventure. Incredibly soft and sensual, their pop music lo -fi takes us to their planet where there are no taboos and societal codes no longer exist. A barred universe that this Strabourgeois duo offers us on a set.**"**

##  Hubert Le Noir feat Bonnie Banane - Octembre
Anaïs G: **"**From the first notes of this title, I immediately hooked. A little sound of robot and people outside. Then, I was amazed to hear the voice of the talented Bonnie Banane but especially that of Hubert Le Noir who totally shocked me and kept me in my air until the end of the song. While waiting for the second album “Pictura de Ipse” we let ourselves go by dancing on “Octembre.” **"**

## Le Noiseur - Relax
Anaïs G: **"**In the same atmosphere, a little chill and offbeat we have Le Noiseur. It is a revival in the 90s that Simon Campocasso offers us for his return.**"**

## Slim & The Beast - Tongue Tied
 Anaïs G: **"**To prolong the summer and this very chill-groovy selection, a rather soft title of the trio franco -American -Spanish.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
