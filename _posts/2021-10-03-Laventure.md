# Laventure's selection

## Franck Zappa - Advance Romance
Laventure: **"**This choice really comes from the bottom of my heart… My dad always tells the story of how he used to listen to this CD, especially this song with the hypnotic Captain Beefheart, in the family’s car when I was just a baby sitting in the back seat.When I listen to this track, I still get the same feeling I got then… I wished above anything else in the world to be Terry Bozzio (the drummer)! My imaginary world would mix all of my dad’s anecdotes about the gigs he went to… It was spectacular, just like Frank Zappa’s career. That strange character with a sharp face, a goatee with this musketeer vibe as thick as a cigarette paper. Genius? Mad scientist? Punk? Soul man? It’s almost impossible to love all his craft but contrary to what people usually think, there’s a ZAPPA for everyone. **"**

## Q - Alone
Laventure: **"**Man this summer was hard haha. Boris and I spent almost the whole season in our bedrooms working on our next project while our friends left for the holidays… Since we had different tasks, we didn’t even see each other that much. I had to record the vocals for the tracks and Boris had to rearrange them. That was a lonely and challenging time but it was also so enriching and rewarding. It’s this kind of period in your life where you have no choice but to grow.So I used to listen to this masterpiece when I felt down. There’s something so soothing and comforting about this song. I don’t know what but it makes me feel better!**"**

## Broncho - Get in My Car 
Laventure: **"**This song makes us want to get on the road with our team again. I think it’s a love song? Haha. But the lyrics quite apply to our friendship. We wouldn’t want to make it on our own. We’ve got each other and we’ll try to go as far as possible together… Wow that was cheesy af, but sincere hahaha.**"**
