# Laventure's selection

## Franck Zappa - Advance Romance
Laventure: **"**This choice really comes from the bottom of my heart… My dad always tells the story of how he used to listen to this CD, especially this song with the hypnotic Captain Beefheart, in the family’s car when I was just a baby sitting in the back seat.When I listen to this track, I still get the same feeling I got then… I wished above anything else in the world to be Terry Bozzio (the drummer)! My imaginary world would mix all of my dad’s anecdotes about the gigs he went to… It was spectacular, just like Frank Zappa’s career. That strange character with a sharp face, a goatee with this musketeer vibe as thick as a cigarette paper. Genius? Mad scientist? Punk? Soul man? It’s almost impossible to love all his craft but contrary to what people usually think, there’s a ZAPPA for everyone. **"**

## Q - Alone
Laventure: **"**Man this summer was hard haha. Boris and I spent almost the whole season in our bedrooms working on our next project while our friends left for the holidays… Since we had different tasks, we didn’t even see each other that much. I had to record the vocals for the tracks and Boris had to rearrange them. That was a lonely and challenging time but it was also so enriching and rewarding. It’s this kind of period in your life where you have no choice but to grow.**"**

##  - Understanding
Tomu DJ: **"**1990s American R&B is my greatest inspiration and recently I've been really into Xscape. What I love about this song and a lot of music of this era is the lyrics and how they are always relevant. Songs like this get to the heart of concepts like love and relationships in an all-encompassing way that a lot of music does not.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Tomu DJ](http://tomu.dj/) - Pretty Stuff
Jules: **"**It's hard to choose just one track from Tomu DJ's intimate debut album, FEMINISTA, as each piece is traversed by this melancholy and this deep sadness. I love this track for its rapid-fire rhythms that echoes the sounds of techno clubs, and its heady melody that might evoke a late night drive, with both nostalgia and hints of hopefulness.**"**

## [Longhair](https://longhairlive.bandcamp.com/) - Ja Wie? (80 bpm)
Jules: **"**A 130 bpm track for the peaktime of your evening, the same 80 bpm track for a wake-up call wrapped in a strange sweetness, a last track that makes me want to go for an energetic afternoon trip in the forest, Longhair has found the recipe for a perfect EP.**"**

## [Elkka](https://elkka.bandcamp.com/) - Burnt Orange
Jules: **"**One of my favorite songs from summer 2021! Taken from 'Euphoric Melodies', the last EP from London based producer, DJ and label boss Elkka, this vibrant track is full of optimism and freedom, perfect for the damp atmosphere of clubs or the first rays of the sun in the morning.**"**

## [Adelheid X & Giraffi Dog](https://doomchakratapes.bandcamp.com/album/adelheid-x-giraffi-dog-combien-de-temps) - Combien De Temps
Jules: **"**Is it already autumn? With this song that never seems to want to end, Adelheid X and Giraffi Dog team up to prolong the drunkenness of summer.**"**
