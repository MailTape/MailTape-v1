<p id="introduction">This wonderfully bright morning we are thrilled to welcome Brooklyn-based beatsmith, [jitwam.](https://www.facebook.com/jitwam/), to MailTape. His languid and soulful selections slowly evaporate the dew and drag the melodies out into the light.</p>
<p>On his full-length debut, [ज़ितम सिहँ](https://cosmic-compositions.bandcamp.com/album/--2), Jitwam. deconstructs samples of folk and jazz guitar as they buzz and hiss alongside the warm reverie of vinyl drum samples.</p>


# Jitwam.'s selection


## Cara Tivey Trio – Contemplation
_Jitwam_: **"**Wake up slow...let the world come to you. [Cara Tivey](https://soundcloud.com/cara-t) on keysss and blissful harmonies.**"**

## Jay Electronica – Dear Moleskine
_Jitwam_: **"**[Jay Electronica](https://soundcloud.com/jayelectronica) is light. No matter how fast he raps, his words enter my consciousness so slowwww. An inspiration for the inspired.**"**

## Sam Reed – Love Ain't Free
_Jitwam_: **"**If you wants to feels good you got to listen to music that makes you feel good. This tune always puts a spring in my step and some melancholy in my whistle.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## jitwam. – alone
_Sanjay_: **"**There's a simmering storm beneath the acoustic strums of this track, coerced by generous helpings of reverb and musings on isolation.**"**

## Henry Wu – Shahada
_Sanjay_: **"**[Henry Wu](http://www.smarturl.it/kw-thereturn) and [Kieron Ifill](http://blog.nutriot.com/tag/kieron-ifill) combine to provide a two-step bedrock for delicate strings to glide over, sitting alongside an infectious and restless b-line with just enough groove for a Sunday morning.**"**

## Nabihah Iqbal – Eden Piece
_Sanjay_: **"**Lull yourself into a hazy dream this morning with [Nabihah Iqbal](https://nabihahiqbal.bandcamp.com/)'s pared-back track, Eden Piece. All wandering and lilting piano lines, booming kicks and breathy vocals.**"**

## Yves Tumor – The Feeling When You Walk Away
_Sanjay_: **"**From a cavernous looping riff reveals [Yves Tumor](https://soundcloud.com/yvestumor/)’s voice, an anguished falsetto steeped in phantasmal echoes that sounds as if it’s simultaneously vanishing just as it’s appearing.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Jitwam.](https://www.facebook.com/jitwam/) for being our guest today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
