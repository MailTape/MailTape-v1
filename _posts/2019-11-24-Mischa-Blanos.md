# Mischa Blanos' selection


## Toshio Matsuura Group - Change
Mischa Blanos: **"** For me is like waking up to reality from a dream that didn't finish, making my way through the day with heavy steps. The amazing intervention and continuation of the brass section is the melancholy state which convey that our role in life is to wake up and afterwards getting back to our deepest sleep. The drums, the bass and the synthesisers are the tip of the iceberg. They made a really beautiful version after the original track composed by Bugge Wesseltoft. **"**

## Dictaphone - 105.4
Mischa Blanos: **"** This original sound of mixing acoustic and electronic gives me a strong belief that music is evolving so much that we are still empowered to change the world the way we want it to be. As you can see the Ostinato (repetition) give us a strong meaning of meditation through music, something that we comprehend this but don't realised it.**"**

## Mehliana (Brad Mehldau & Mark Guiliana) - Just Call Me Nige (Live)
Mischa Blanos: **"** No need for introduction for these two astounding artists who are playing by their own rules - that being said, new rhythm, harmonies and forms are born worldwide inspiring other artists to be off limits. Without this way of thinking, I have no idea if we can survive on a daily basis in terms of emotions. **"**
