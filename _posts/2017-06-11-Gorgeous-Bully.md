<p id="introduction">This morning, [Gorgeous Bully](https://www.facebook.com/gorgeousbullyband/ "Facebook") bedroom-pop.</p>


# **Gorgeous Bully's selection**

+ ## Spinning Coin - Albany
_Gorgeous Bully_: **"**Featuring members of The Yawns and other Scottish indie heroes, the sound of a lazy Sunday morning captured perfectly for sure.**"**

+ ## songsforwalter - Useless
_SUUNS_: **"**One of Manchester's heroes I've had the pleasure of knowing for a few years, crafting songs under this moniker about his grandfather's life and times. Perfect for when you're feeling 'useless' dreading the week ahead realising nothing has changed.**"**

+ ## WAITERS - Mirror Threat
_SUUNS_: **"**I know almost nothing of this band except that they are another Manchester band. Elusive and releasing music sporadically but everything is a step above the rest. Not just for Sunday mornings though, perfect for any time and any day.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Gorgeous Bully - Never Cry
_Inès_: **"**It was hard for me to pick Gorgeous Bully song, as I could easily just have given a link to their whole discography. "Never cry" is one of my favorite songs, **"** 

+ ## THESE GUY - Suburban Restaurant
_Inès_: **"**"Suburban Restaurant" is a song about growing up and feeling stuck in a place that doesn't seem to have changed that much over time, wrapped in layers of instrumental cuteness.**"**

+ ## Jimmy Whispers - (Summer in Pain)
_Inès_: **"**I have a love/hate relationship with summer, so I was drawn to this song's title. But it's not only liking a title here. The DIY side, the sweet notes on the organ, the slow singing, the melancholic voice... all of this feels like an optimistic representation of shitty summers.**"**

+ ## Aldous RH - Feelin Blue
_Inès_: **"**Manchester is filled with amazing artists, and Aldous RH is no exception. Always creating groovy tunes, "Feelin Blue" is his latest release: a catchy, dreamy and summery track. Heartache has never sounded so sweet.**"**
