<p id="introduction">This morning, let's have a mellow Sunday morning thanks to [Gorgeous Bully](https://www.facebook.com/gorgeousbullyband/ "Facebook")'s heartwarming selection.
Manchester based Gorgeous Bully makes lo-fi, DIY bedroom grunge-pop tracks. Catchy, minimal and sincere, Gorgeous Bully's music is striking, and welcomed in current times.</p>


# **Gorgeous Bully's selection**

+ ## Spinning Coin - Albany
_Gorgeous Bully_: **"**Featuring members of The Yawns and other Scottish indie heroes, the sound of a lazy Sunday morning captured perfectly for sure.**"**

+ ## songsforwalter - Useless
_Gorgeous Bully_: **"**One of Manchester's heroes I've had the pleasure of knowing for a few years, crafting songs under this moniker about his grandfather's life and times. Perfect for when you're feeling 'useless' dreading the week ahead realising nothing has changed.**"**

+ ## WAITERS - Mirror Threat
_Gorgeous Bully_: **"**I know almost nothing of this band except that they are another Manchester band. Elusive and releasing music sporadically but everything is a step above the rest. Not just for Sunday mornings though, perfect for any time and any day.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Gorgeous Bully - Never Cry
_Inès_: **"**Manchester has an amazing musical scene, and to me, Gorgeous Bully is one of the best bands there. "Never Cry" is one of my favorite Gorgeous Bully songs, with cheerful instruments and self-interrogating lyrics. Ambivalent and honest, it sounds like some kind of anthem for when you feel hurt, lost or mad at yourself. Just sing along to the "ba da dums".**"** 

+ ## These Guy - Suburban Restaurant
_Inès_: **"**"Suburban Restaurant" is a song about growing up and feeling stuck in a place that doesn't seem to have changed that much over time, a feeling shared by many I guess, wrapped in layers of instrumental cuteness.**"**

+ ## Jimmy Whispers - (Summer in Pain)
_Inès_: **"**I have a love/hate relationship with summer, so I was drawn to this song's title. But it's not only liking a title here. The DIY side, the sweet notes of the organ, the slow singing, the melancholic voice... all of this feels like an optimistic representation of shitty summers.**"**

+ ## Aldous RH - Feelin Blue
_Inès_: **"**Another great Mancunian artist here. Aldous RH always creates groovy tunes, and "Feelin Blue", his latest release, is no exception. A catchy, dreamy and summery track. Heartache has never sounded so sweet.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [Gorgeous Bully](https://www.facebook.com/gorgeousbullyband/ "Facebook") for their participation, and [Camille Célestin](http://www.slipontherock.com/ "Website") for the illustration. Have a great Sunday! </p>
