<p id="introduction"> This morning, .
<br><br>
[Brijean](https://brijean.bandcamp.com/) is Brijean Murphy and Doug Stuart.
</p>


# Brijean's selection


## John Cameron - Liquid Sunshine
Brijean & Doug: **"**This has been the song that plays as Doug's alarm on his phone. It still hasn't worn itself out for us, so we figured it would be a good one to start with.**"**

## Mi Alma - Olinga
Brijean & Doug: **"**This is a deep cut recording of Brijean's dad's band from the 70s (Rereleased in 2014 to CD). The vibes are silky and sunkissed. Perfect for a slow dance around the house.**"**

## Kool & The Gang - You Don't Have to Change
Brijean & Doug: **"**Such a beautiful song with a timeless feel.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Brijean](https://brijean.bandcamp.com/) - Meet Me After Dark
Jules: **"**Now that Brijean's dreamy selection has peacefully woken you up, it's time for a morning exercise 'Meet Me After Dark', taken from Brijean's first EP ['Walkie Talkie'](https://brijean.bandcamp.com/album/walkie-talkie) released late June, will surely make you move with its elegant back-room disco rythmic.**"**

## [Channel Tres](https://channeltres.bandcamp.com/) - Brilliant Nigga
Jules: **"**The Compton-born artist could have stuck to West Coast rap, like many others before him, but his discovery of house music with Moodymann changed everything. On this track, Detroit house flirts with the basement soul of Chicago, with the blessing of Channel's effortlessly deep voice. **"**

## [Flying Lotus](http://flying-lotus.com/) - Takashi
Jules: **"**The LA-based producer is back with his new album 'Flamagra', and I still don't know if this experimental jazz trip sounds more like the future of music or a track from a different dimension**"**

## Serge Gainsbourg - Aux Armes Et Cætera
Jules: **"**It's Bastille Day today, so always a special occasion to listen to the National Anthem of France. No flambloyant military parade on the Champs-Élysées for me, thanks. A quiet and blissful walk in a park or next to the canal listening to Serge Gainsbourg's legendary reggae version of 'La Marseillaise' will be much better.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always thank you so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Brijean](https://brijean.bandcamp.com/) for their Sunday selections, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for this stunning illustration. </p>
