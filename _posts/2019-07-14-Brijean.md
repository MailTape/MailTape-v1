<p id="introduction"> This morning, whether on sunny beaches, palm groves or lush oases, or just enjoying a fine breakfast in your bed, allow yourself to be soothed by a strange and unique shade of Soul born in Finland but balancing international influences.
<br><br>
[Brijean](https://brijean.bandcamp.com/) is Brijean Murphy and Doug Stuart.
</p>




# Brijean's selection



## John Cameron - Liquid Sunshine
Brijean: **"**This has been the song that plays as Doug's alarm on his phone. It still hasn't worn itself out for us, so we figured it would be a good one to start with.**"**

## Mi Alma - Olinga
Brijean: **"**This is a deep cut recording of Brijean's dad's band from the 70s (Rereleased in 2014 to CD). The vibes are silky and sunkissed. Perfect for a slow dance around the house.**"**

## Kool & The Gang - You Don't Have to Change
Brijean: **"**Such a beautiful song with a timeless feel.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Brijean](https://brijean.bandcamp.com/) - This Love
Jules: **"**'This Love' is Bobby Oroza's debut single, taken from the eponymous album. On this record Bobby, teaming up with the band Cold Diamond & Mink, provides a dark and intimate atmosphere, "breaking hearts on some tunes and mending them on others". This song can do both, and even inspired the hip hop scene, as it was sampled by Earl Sweatshirt in his song '[Hat Trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_bqOK56lu8)'.  **"**

## [Channel Tres](https://channeltres.bandcamp.com/) - nervous
Jules: **"**Jonah Yano is a Toronto-based musician, originally hailing from Hiroshima, Japan. After hearing an early demo of 'nervous' he recorded through his cellphone in 2016, BADBADNOTGOOD invited him to their legendary Studio 69 where they offered to produce and play on the track. Downtempo instrumentals meet autotune vocals for a melancholic ballad, that is perfect for a slow wake up Sunday morning.**"**

## [Flying Lotus](http://flying-lotus.com/) - Takashi
Jules: **"**Nilüfer Yanya grew up in West London, she released her debut album 'Miss Universe' in March 2019, after three EPs on london indie label Blue Flowers and a place earned on the BBC Sound of 2018 longlist. On this album, the 23-year-old artist – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – explores themes of paranoia and anxiety, centering around a fictional health management company called WE WORRY ABOUT YOUR HEALTH. “Melt” finds her strumming her guitar in a jazzier mode, backed by percolating electronic percussion and a saxophone. ‘I bet your brain cells won’t last’ she gently sings with laid-back coolness in her voice.**"**

## Serge Gainsbourg - Aux Armes Et Cætera
Jules: **"****"**



<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always thank you so much for listening. Much love and respect to Bobby for his Sunday selections, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration. </p>
