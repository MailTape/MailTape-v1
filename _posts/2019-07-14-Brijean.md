<p id="introduction"> This morning, whether on sunny beaches, palm groves or lush oases, or just enjoying a fine breakfast in your bed, allow yourself to be soothed by a strange and unique shade of Soul born in Finland but balancing international influences.
<br><br>
[Brijean](https://brijean.bandcamp.com/) is Brijean Murphy and Doug Stuart.
</p>




# Brijean's selection



## John Cameron - Liquid Sunshine
Brijean: **"**This has been the song that plays as Doug's alarm on his phone. It still hasn't worn itself out for us, so we figured it would be a good one to start with.**"**

## Mi Alma - Olinga
Brijean: **"**This is a deep cut recording of Brijean's dad's band from the 70s (Rereleased in 2014 to CD). The vibes are silky and sunkissed. Perfect for a slow dance around the house.**"**

## Kool & The Gang - You Don't Have to Change
Brijean: **"**Such a beautiful song with a timeless feel.**"**


# MailTape's selection
