<p id="introduction"> This morning, let's revel in the lush universe of Maenad Veyl, one of precisely crafted sounds and carefuly built momentums. His attention to detail and riveting atmospheres shine through his productions or the work of the artists he promotes on VEYL, the label he co-runs with Alex Knoblauch. The selection he prepared this sunday is no exception to that, a stroll through fresh ambient layers, warm and ... jazz or ... (and ...) ... .
  
Thomas Feriero has been producing music under multiple monikers - he's also known as Avatism, and part of the duo CW/A with his partner in crime Clockwork -

# Maenad Veyl's selection


## MY DISCO - Exercise in Sacrifice
Maenad Veyl : **"**I thought ‘Severe’ was one of the freshest things in recent years and I’m happy to say I’m enjoying their album even more. This track and ‘Rival Colour’ are really something else. It’s all quite dark but there’s something meditative and peaceful about this one.**"**

## KOKOROKO - Adwa
Maenad Veyl : **"**For some reason this song just makes me think of a huge cup of black coffee. I am trying to drink less coffee and this is currently the only alternative that really works.**"**

## Ed Rush - Skylab
Maenad Veyl : **"**Good old Metalheadz classic for when things really need to get rolling. My go-to tune on walks to the studio.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Maenad Veyl - In Ruins
Luc P : **"** **"**

## Zavaloka - Gromovytsya | Громовиця
Luc P : **"** **"**

## Luar Domatrix - Una Lira
Luc P : **"** **"**

## Simo Cell - As Long As We Have Those Things 
Luc P : **"****"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning! As always thank you for listening. Much love and respect to Maenad Veyl for his selection, and to ... for this stunning illustration. </p>
